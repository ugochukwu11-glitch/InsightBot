Read our Privacy notice Serious concerns have been raised that newly sacked US ambassador Peter Mandelson did not clear security vetting for the role – but the prime minister pushed through his appointment anyway. Sources have told The Independent that MI6 failed to clear the Labour peer largely because of concerns over his business links to China. However, there were also worries that his past links to the disgraced financier and convicted paedophile Jeffrey Epstein “would compromise him”. The row has broken out as Sir Keir Starmer faces serious questions about his judgment from his political opponents, but also from Labour MPs after Lord Mandelson became the latest high-profile sacking by the prime minister over issues that should have been detected earlier. When The Independent put the claims that Sir Keir had pushed through Lord Mandelson’s appointment despite not clearing MI6 vetting, a spokesperson said: “Vetting done by FCDO in normal way.” Lord Mandelson’s dramatic sacking came after a string of shocking revelations , including emails appearing to show him offering support for Epstein as he was facing charges of child sex offences. Announcing his departure, Foreign Office minister Stephen Doughty claimed that the emails showed the depth and extent of the pair’s relationship was “materially different from that known at the time of his appointment”, while Sir Keir said he found the emails “reprehensible”. Questions were immediately raised about what Sir Keir knew and when, and whether the vetting process for the coveted and powerful government job was robust enough. Now, further questions are being asked of the prime minister’s judgment after it emerged that security services had raised concerns before Lord Mandelson was appointed. Tory leader Kemi Badenoch described the overruling of MI6 warnings to appoint a political ally as “unforgivable”. She said: “These latest revelations point yet again to the terrible judgement of Keir Starmer and why it is imperative that all documents relating to Peter Mandelson’s appointment are released immediately. “If it is true that Starmer or his chief of staff Morgan McSweeney overruled the security services, as has been alleged, they need immediately to explain to the public why they did so.” Shadow foreign secretary Dame Priti Patel, who had similar security briefings from MI5 as home secretary, said: “These are extraordinary revelations. For Keir Starmer and Morgan McSweeney to have appointed Lord Mandelson despite concerns being raised by the security services shows a blatant disregard of all national security considerations and their determination to promote their Labour Party friends.” A former senior cabinet minister told The Independent that any security concerns would have been raised privately between the head of MI6, the foreign secretary and the prime minister. It means that the new deputy prime minister, David Lammy, who was the foreign secretary at the time, would also have been informed about any issues with the appointment. Asked whether No 10 ignored security concerns reportedly flagged by security services before the appointment, the spokesperson said: “No 10 was not involved in the security vetting process. This is managed at departmental level by the agency responsible and any suggestion that No 10 was involved is untrue.” But in an explanation on X (Twitter), former foreign secretary James Cleverly, who made many diplomatic appointments, insisted that all security and other concerns about Lord Mandelson would have been presented to the foreign secretary and prime minister by officials and the security services. He wrote: “They would have reminded Lammy that Mandelson had resigned in disgrace twice before. They would have reminded Lammy that Mandelson had a longstanding relationship with Epstein. They would have reminded Lammy that Mandelson had widespread, complicated, and opaque commercial interests. “I have no doubt that they would have reminded Lammy that he and the PM were importing significant reputational risk if they appointed Mandelson. I have no doubt they would have unambiguously advised Lammy against appointing Mandelson to the post. “And it is now clear that Lammy and Starmer ignored that advice and appointed him anyway.” Lord Mandelson was already a controversial pick for the role, with The Independent revealing that Donald Trump was minded to reject his credentials in January after the inauguration because of security concerns over his business links with Beijing. At the time, sources close to the US president suggested that he would struggle to share confidential information with the Labour peer because of the perceived problems. But after a massive diplomatic push, Sir Keir succeeded in getting President Trump to accept Lord Mandelson because he wanted the architect of New Labour, known by many as the “Prince of Darkness”, to be responsible for the UK’s most important diplomatic relationship. Now, Labour MPs are publicly and privately questioning Sir Keir’s judgement in appointing him. Bell Ribeiro-Addy, who attempted to run for the deputy leadership contest, said: “There were clearly double standards here. Good people were blocked from being candidates for liking the wrong tweets, but Mandelson was appointed despite all his baggage.” The comments echo concerns within the party after a string of embarrassing sackings. Starmer last week lost deputy prime minister Angela Rayner for failing to pay £40,000 of stamp duty while she was housing secretary. Homelessness minister Rushanara Ali lost her job after she made her tenants homeless, while anti-corruption minister, Tulip Siddiq, quit after she was investigated for corruption through her family’s now-ended autocratic regime in Bangladesh. And former transport secretary, Louise Haigh, resigned over revelations she was prosecuted and found guilty of falsely claiming a mobile phone was stolen from her. Mr Doughty announced the sacking while answering an urgent question from Tory MP Neil O’Brien, who said: “The simple question is this: is the minister now saying that the prime minister did not know about any of this at the point where [Lord Mandelson] was appointed? What did the prime minister know at the point of his appointment?” Labour foreign affairs select committee chair Dame Emily Thornberry revealed that MPs had been blocked from questioning Lord Mandelson. She said: “Since the first rumours of his appointment, my committee has repeatedly asked – publicly and privately – to question Peter Mandelson. It is right that he has now been sacked. “The FCDO should not have stopped us from asking questions. The government should welcome such scrutiny.” Join thought-provoking conversations, follow other Independent readers and see their replies", "published": "2025-09-11T17:09:57.000Z", "length": 7017, "source": "www.independent.co.uk"}

Read our Privacy notice Police have released two photos of a “person of interest” as the manhunt for Charlie Kirk ’s killer remains ongoing 24 hours after the right-wing political activist and ally of Donald Trump was fatally shot at a Utah college campus. The images showed a man wearing a hat, sunglasses and a dark shirt which appeared to have an image of the American flag on it. Earlier, officials from the FBI and Utah Department of Public Safety provided updates Thursday on their investigation into the shooting , which unfolded in front of a large outdoor crowd at a Utah Valley University event in Orem around 12:20 p.m. Wednesday. DPS Commissioner Beau Mason revealed that the shooter, who is believed to be around “college age,” arrived on campus around 11:52 a.m., before jumping off a nearby rooftop after the shooting and making his escape into a neighborhood. Robert Bohls, the special agent in charge of the FBI’s Salt Lake field office, said that authorities found a “high-powered bolt-action rifle” in a wooded area, which they believed was used to kill Kirk . Bohls said investigators also “collected a footwear impression, palm print and forearm imprints for analysis.” The president announced Thursday, during a 9/11 remembrance ceremony at the Pentagon, that Kirk would posthumously receive the Presidential Medal of Freedom. Charlie Kirk, the MAGA stalwart and Donald Trump ally, died on Wednesday at the age of 31, after being shot in the neck at a college event in Utah. As authorities hunt for a suspect, here’s what you need to know this morning: Utah students are generally allowed to open-carry firearms on public college campuses, making it more difficult to assess whether security threats could have been identified if a gunman was carrying a weapon, law enforcement experts told The Independent. Clarifications to state law that went into effect in May allow anyone who is 18 years of age or older and who has a concealed-carry permit to bring a firearm to campus, whether the weapon is concealed or open-carried. The University of Utah’s website says concealed carry is permitted but suggests “there is nothing specifically set forth in the Utah statutes that allows a concealed firearm permit holder” to carry a firearm openly. The state allows the purchase and possession of firearms in most cases without a license or permit. Comedy Central has pulled a rerun of a “South Park” episode, scheduled for Wednesday, that mocked Charlie Kirk, according to the Wall Street Journal. The episode, called “Got A Nut,” featured Eric Cartman as a parody of Kirk speaking to students about his conservative political views, with a hairstyle similar to the MAGA broadcaster. Kirk previously called his parody “a badge of honor” and told Fox News ahead of the episode “we as conservatives need to be able to take a joke.” A Thursday afternoon press conference to provide updates in the investigation into the killing of Charlie Kirk has been postponed until further notice. “Due to the rapid developments in our investigation, we will suspend this [briefing]. We will release an updated time later today,” a spokesperson said. An assistant dean at a Tennessee university has been fired over a social media posts in which she said she had \"zero sympathy\" MAGA broadcaster Charlie Kirk following his death. The comments were highlighted online by Tennessee Senator Marsha Backburn online, with the president of Middle Tennessee State University releasing a statement shortly after. “An MTSU employee today offered inappropriate and callous comments on social media concerning the horrific and tragic murder of Charlie Kirk.,” president Sidney A. McPhee wrote. “The comments by this employee, who worked in a position of trust directly with students, were inconsistent with our values and have undermined the university’s credibility and reputation with our students, faculty, staff and the community at large. “This employee has been fired effective immediately. We extend our deepest sympathies to the Kirk family.” Utah law enforcement officials are due to give another new conference later Thursday. The briefing is set to take place around 12:45 p.m. local time. FBI Special Agent in Charge Robert Bohls and DPS Commissioner Beau Mason. Vice President JD Vance and his wife Usha Vance are set to meet with the family and close friends of Charlie Kirk before traveling from Utah to Arizona with his casket, according to sources. The Vances will meet with Kirk’s loved ones in Salt Lake City before boarding Air Force Two and heading back to Arizona, where the MAGA broadcaster lived with his wife and two children. The vice president and his wife were originally scheduled to visit Ground Zero in New York City to commemorate the 24th anniversary of 9/11, but flew to Utah after Kirk was fatally shot. A senior law enforcement official told the New York Times that reports that the shooter's rifle contained ammunition with statements “expressing transgender and anti-fascist” statements “might turn out to have been misread or misinterpreted.” Early Thursday, the Wall Street Journal reported, citing a law enforcement bulletin and a source familiar with the investigation, that ammunition inside the rifle was engraved with ideological messages. The FBI declined to comment to The Independent. However, the official told The Times that the report had not been verified by analysts at the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, and did not match other summaries of the evidence. The FBI said at a Thursday press conference that a gun had been found in a wooded area near to where the fatal shooting of Charlie Kirk took place. Charlie Kirk's casket will be flown from Utah back to Arizona, where he lived with his family aboard Air Force Two. The journey will take place later Thursday, according to The Associated Press.

Read our Privacy notice The Green Party’s new leader claims he has had multiple conversations with Labour MPs about defecting to his party as they become increasingly unhappy with the direction of Sir Keir Starmer’s government . In an interview with The Independent , Zack Polanski said the number of Labour MPs he has spoken to who are dissatisfied with the party was in “double figures”. He added that the Greens would “absolutely” welcome disillusioned MPs, as long as they share the party’s values. Mr Polanski named Labour left-wingers Clive Lewis and Nadia Whittome as “obvious” examples of the MPs he would welcome into the fold. It comes amid growing concern from backbenchers over Sir Keir’s leadership, with his approval rating hitting an all-time low last month. The beleaguered PM has come under the spotlight this week after being forced to sack Lord Peter Mandelson as US ambassador following a string of claims about his relationship with disgraced financier Jeffrey Epstein. The fresh revelations emerged just days after his former deputy Angela Rayner was forced to resign. Asked if he would accept defectors from the Labour Party, Mr Polanski said: “Undoubtedly, there are Labour politicians that I would accept defections from. Not all of them, it’s really important to point out that caveat. “It’s also important to point out that it wouldn’t be my decision; it would be a democratic decision made by an elected body, but that’s quite a technical answer. So I’ll answer a question directly: would I accept, as in would I encourage defections? Absolutely.” He added: “I’ve had lots of conversations with Labour MPs concerned about where the Labour Party are going. Those are probably in double figures the amount of conversations I’ve had with Labour MPs. In terms of talking to Labour MPs about defections, that’s a smaller number, but yes, absolutely, I’m having conversations with Labour MPs who are considering defecting. “If they align with our values, then it makes absolutely no sense to be in the Labour Party any more.” Mr Polanski also addressed the growing speculation that the Greens could unite with Jeremy Corbyn and Zarah Sultana’s new party to create a new force on the left in British politics. He said he would not be open to a total merger with the as-yet-unnamed party, but added he would be happy for their movement to join the Green Party and operate under that banner. Mr Polanski has previously indicated a willingness to cooperate with the new left-wing party. “If they all wanted to join the Green Party and be in the Green Party, I’d absolutely consider that merger. But I guess that’s not a merger … In terms of a merger between whatever their party is and the Green Party, then that’s definitely not something I’m considering,” he said. During the interview, Mr Polanski – who said he is hoping to get as many as 39 MPs at the next election – also took aim at Sir Keir, arguing he is “an abject failure as a prime minister because he is refusing to acknowledge the feedback in the country right now, that people are angry”. “They are absolutely furious with politics, and the danger is that this starts to wash over everyone. And that’s why I believe that Reform are topping the polls – because here they come, saying ‘we’re all angry at the old two-party system. It is crumbled, it has failed, and we are here to present solutions now’. “I actually agree with Nigel Farage, with much of his diagnosis of the problem. The real thing here, though, is that his solutions won’t make anything better. In fact, they’ll make things significantly worse.” As a result, he said there is a “real role here for the Green Party” to hold the Labour government to account. “Do I think they’ve done everything wrong? No, that would be childish of me. There are small things where I think they’re moving things in the right direction, but again, it is so half-hearted that it almost makes things worse,” he added. Mr Polanski is trying to take the fight to Reform UK, previously pitching himself as the “Nigel Farage of the left”. Appealing directly to disillusioned voters, he said: “If you voted for this Labour government because you wanted the change that Keir Starmer promised and all you have got is the two-child benefit cap, cuts to disability benefits and a refusal to tax multimillionaires and billionaires, then you don’t need to go to Reform and the toxic politics of hate and division. “If you want an alternative, the Green Party are there offering the politics of hope and community.” The self-professed “eco-populist” also said “we need to reclaim patriotism”, warning that “inequality is the most unpatriotic thing possible”. Hitting back at Sir Keir, who over the weekend dubbed Mr Polanski a “plastic progressive”, the Green Party leader said: “His patriotism could not be more plastic. He thinks patriotism is waving a flag or claiming that he hangs flags up all the time. That’s not real.” He added: “Inequality is the most unpatriotic thing possible to allow to happen. And actually saying we should share power and wealth around this country, because everyone matters, is exactly what my patriotism is about. “So I throw the gauntlet down to Keir. Show me what you think patriotism means. Stop name-calling.” Mr Lewis and Ms Whittome have been vocal critics of Sir Keir’s government, with both of them rebelling against the government’s controversial welfare cuts earlier this year. Mr Lewis has previously said he is “ashamed” of the approach the government has taken towards Gaza, as well as warning that Sir Keir was betraying Labour values with planned cuts to benefits. The Independent has contacted both MPs for comment. A Labour Party spokesperson said: “Zack Polanski doesn’t have a plan to deliver change, and he’s not serious about the serious times we face internationally. He has repeatedly suggested he would back off from Nato – which would leave Britain’s national security exposed at a time when Putin is waging an illegal war in Ukraine. “And he leads a party that’s Green in name only: plastic progressives who oppose green infrastructure, oppose nuclear, and block housebuilding.

Xi made the statement in a congratulatory message sent to the 2025 China International Fair for Trade in Services, which opened in Beijing on Wednesday with the theme \"Embrace Intelligent Technologies, Empower Trade in Services\". The fair runs through Sunday. He pointed out that global development is facing both challenges and opportunities amid profound changes in the world economic landscape. Xi reaffirmed China's commitment to expanding high-standard opening-up, saying that the nation will actively align with international high-standard economic and trade rules and accelerate the opening of its service market in an orderly manner on platforms such as pilot free trade zones and national demonstration zones for the innovative development of trade in services, in order to promote high-quality development of service trade. China stands ready to work with all parties to build an open world economy and continuously inject fresh impetus into building a community with a shared future for humanity, he said. Hosted by the Ministry of Commerce and the Beijing municipal government, the CIFTIS is the world's largest comprehensive fair for trade in services. A total of 85 countries and international organizations, including Australia, Germany and the World Intellectual Property Organization, have set up booths at this year's fair, according to the Beijing municipal government. Nearly 2,000 companies, such as Walmart, AstraZeneca and KPMG, are using exhibition space during the fair. Australia is the guest country of honor, and nearly 60 Australian companies and institutions are participating in the fair. Addressing the opening ceremony, Vice-Premier Ding Xuexiang said that amid rising unilateralism and protectionism, China has been striving to steadily advance institutional opening-up in service trade and enhance facilitation, making new achievements in promoting high-quality development of service trade. Such achievements not only provide strong momentum for China's own development, but also create more space for global economic growth, he said. Ding called for reducing barriers to service trade to foster a favorable environment for its development, and emphasized the need to strengthen international cooperation in fields such as artificial intelligence and big data. It is important to negotiate more high-standard free trade agreements to promote common prosperity through mutually beneficial cooperation in service trade, he added. The value of China's trade in services reached 4.58 trillion yuan ($643 billion) in the first seven months of 2025, up 8.2 percent year-on-year, data from the Ministry of Commerce showed. In the meantime, trade in knowledge-intensive services increased 6.8 percent year-on-year to over 1.77 trillion yuan. Nie Pingxiang, a researcher specializing in trade in services at the Chinese Academy of International Trade and Economic Cooperation in Beijing, said the steady expansion of China's service trade highlights a structural transition toward higher-value industries, driven by policy incentives, rising consumption and industrial upgrading. At a time when protectionism and unilateralism are adding uncertainty to global markets, advancing trade in services has become a vital buffer for China to mitigate external risks, sustain economic momentum and attract global capital, said Nie. Xu Shaofeng, senior vice-president of French industrial conglomerate Schneider Electric, said the service sector and trade in services have become core components of China's economy. As a comprehensive international platform dedicated to trade in services, the CIFTIS provides domestic as well as global businesses with a vital window to showcase innovation and expand ecosystem cooperation, Xu added. The French company, also a six-time CIFTIS participant, unveiled an upgraded service system during the trade fair this year, showcasing how its service capabilities are now more deeply integrated with the needs of multiple industries. \"The fair also demonstrates China's firm commitment to opening-up, offering multinational corporations, including Schneider Electric, greater opportunities for growth,\" said Xu, adding that the group launched an innovation center for low-voltage power distribution products in Shanghai earlier this month. Poh-Yian Koh, president for China at FedEx Corp, the United States-based express transportation service provider, also sees strong growth potential in China's service trade sector. She said that as the global trade landscape evolves, FedEx will further expand network capacity, digital and automation capabilities and reliable services in China and other parts of the world. \"We are expanding our footprint in China's third-tier cities, enriching inbound flight services, and strengthening connections with Europe and Southeast Asia,\" she said, noting that by leveraging big data, artificial intelligence and other technologies, the company will be able to deliver sustainable, smarter logistics solutions for Chinese exporters and consumers.", "published": "", "length": 5285, "source": "www.chinadaily.com.cn"}

Against the backdrop of the night sky, the statue, whose name is the Chinese translation of the Sanskrit word \"vairocana\", meaning \"illuminator\", looked more solemn and serene, inspiring awe for the ancient piety and artistry that brought it to life. The night tour around Longmen, an artistic trove comprising more than 2,300 caves and niches carved into steep limestone cliffs over a one-kilometer-long stretch mainly from the fifth to the 10th centuries, gained popularity this summer. Since July, the site has received an average of 5,000 to 6,000 visits daily from 5 pm to 9 pm, with peak days exceeding 10,000, according to Yu Jie, Party secretary of the Longmen Grottoes Academy. President Xi Jinping's continuous attention to cave temples has significantly contributed to this popularity. Xi, who is also general secretary of the Communist Party of China Central Committee, has visited all four major cave temples in China and made many instructions about their significance and conservation since 2019. The four grottoes are all treasures of Chinese civilization with significant historical and cultural value, Xi said when he visited the Maijishan Grottoes in Tianshui, Gansu province, on Sept 11 last year. Besides Longmen and Maijishan, the four sites also include the Mogao Caves in Dunhuang, Gansu, and the Yungang Grottoes in Datong, Shanxi province, all UNESCO World Heritage sites. They are outstanding examples of Chinese grotto temples, an important Buddhist art form that was introduced to China via the ancient Silk Road during the third century. In August 2019, Xi arrived in Gansu for an inspection and made the first stop at Dunhuang. Touring the Mogao Caves, he checked the work of cultural relics protection and research, and emphasized the need to preserve the finer features of the nation's culture. The Mogao Caves site, at the religious and cultural crossroads on the ancient Silk Road, boasts more than 700 Buddhist caves featuring exquisite murals and statues from the fourth to the 14th centuries. Xi also met Fan Jinshi, honorary director of the Dunhuang Academy, who was born in Beijing and raised in Shanghai, but chose to work in Dunhuang, a remote and arid desert region in Northwest China, for six decades. Xi highlighted the \"Mogao spirit\", forged by heritage protectors such as Fan, which values insistence, contribution, a sense of responsibility and pioneering. Experts noted that cave temples, often located in remote mountainous areas and exposed to the natural environment, are difficult to protect and manage, as they frequently face threats such as water damage, earthquakes, unstable rock foundations and weathering, as well as human-induced damage. \"Despite the difficulties, China's efforts to protect its cave temples have endured for eight decades,\" said Su Bomin, director of the Dunhuang Academy. \"We have continuously explored technologies and accumulated experience in restoring the Mogao Caves, developing a comprehensive set of programs that have been applied not only in domestic grottoes but also to sites overseas.\" Su said that the approach to protecting China's cave temples is currently experiencing a leap from a \"rescue restoration\" mindset to one focused on \"preventive protection\". Hang Kan, director of the Yungang Research Institute, said that in recent years, professionals have intensified their efforts in the digital collection of information from the caves of the Yungang Grottoes, striving to \"seize the information at the moment\". \"Grottoes are changing every day, and so is the information they carry. We want to capture every moment to preserve as much information as possible,\" said Hang. He added that they have collected information from 80 percent of the caves, which will serve as a reference for their long-term protection. On the other hand, restorers are actively exploring new technologies and materials for cave temple restoration. For example, in the 1970s, epoxy resin was frequently used in restoring cultural relics in caves due to its strong adhesion, excellent versatility and chemical resistance, making it an advanced new material at that time. However, after decades of use, professionals have discovered that epoxy resin materials are not good enough, as they age and deteriorate under high temperatures. Therefore, they are developing new materials. Experts from Chongqing University are exploring a way of using microorganisms in the restoration of cultural relics as an alternative to epoxy resin. By introducing specific microbial strains under suitable environmental conditions, bioadhesives can be synthesized, and these can then be applied to reinforce cracked relics, offering benefits such as greater compatibility, non-toxicity, environmental friendliness and stronger weather resistance, according to Hang. \"The protection of cave temples is not a once-and-for-all project. With changes in time and climate, new problems arise, bringing fresh challenges and prompting us to continuously seek new materials, innovative ideas and advanced technological methods for their preservation,\" he said. Behind the progress is the persistent dedication of heritage protectors, year after year. In September last year, Xi, at Maijishan, encouraged cultural heritage professionals to inherit the \"Mogao spirit\", remain dedicated to safeguarding the nation's treasures and to contribute greater efforts to the preservation and innovation of China's fine traditional culture, as well as the improvement of the influence of Chinese culture. Cave temples are often located in remote areas, sometimes lacking good environmental conditions. According to Yue Yongqiang, deputy director of the Maijishan Grottoes art research institute, heritage protectors can withstand the loneliness and stay for decades because they are obsessed with the charm of traditional Chinese culture and art, find their research direction there, and are committed to intensive studies of their subjects. \"It's all about insistence, passion and love,\" said Yue. He said that predecessors such as Fan have set good examples for them. \"They possess ideas and beliefs, love their cause and are not willing to give up their research, forming the precious 'Mogao spirit',\" said Yue. \"Their spirit has inspired more people to join, reminding us that despite the hardships, our work is very meaningful.\" In May, Xi visited the Longmen Grottoes and called for protecting, inheriting and promoting the treasures of Chinese culture well. Hang, director of the Yungang Research Institute, said: \"Although protection is our priority, it's not reasonable to keep the relics sealed. Instead, we aim to strike a balance between protection and utilization, which means that while ensuring their protection, we explore ways to bring them back to life so they can benefit the public.\" He said that the institute has organized a series of innovative exhibitions related to Yungang in many cities across the country. In an upcoming exhibition in Shanghai this month, there will be dancing robots based on stone carving figurines from a cave in Yungang. Such efforts have made significant changes. \"We have analyzed the data and found an interesting phenomenon: Every time we organize an exhibition in a city, visitors from that city flock to Yungang afterward. This means that exhibitions are an effective way to promote cave temples. With digital technologies, we will find more ways for such promotion,\" he said.", "published": "", "length": 7676, "source": "www.chinadaily.com.cn"}

The Israeli student was freed from captivity in Iraq – reportedly swapped for prisoners affiliated with Hezbollah-linked factions. ■ A UN official was released by the Houthi rebel group after being kidnapped in a Sanaa raid, the Jordanian Foreign Ministry said. ■ Doha will host an emergency Arab-Islamic summit to discuss the Israeli attack on Qatar. ■ Netanyahu has officially requested that the Senior Appointments Advisory Committee approve the appointment of David Zini as Shin Bet chief . The FBI issued photos of a man it suspects was involved in the Wednesday night murder of far-right influencer Charlie Kirk. \"We are asking for the public's help identifying this person of interest,\" the FBI's Salt Lake City branch wrote on X. The Wall Street Journal said that the ammunition used in the fatal shooting was engraved with anti-fascist and L.G.B.T.Q.-related messages, citing an internal law enforcement document and a source familiar with the investigation. The U.S. defense department said on Wednesday that it approved a security assistance package for Lebanon at an estimated value of $14.2 million. This assistance will \"build the capability and capacity of the Lebanese Armed Forces to dismantle weapons caches and military infrastructure of non-state groups, including Hezbollah,\" the department said in a statement. The deputy director of the UNICEF office in Yemen was released from detention by Houthi rebels in the Yemeni capital city and returned home Thursday to Jordan, the Jordanian foreign ministry said. The freeing of Jordanian citizen Lana Shukri Kataw was announced at a time of high tensions in Yemen and the larger region. Israeli strikes on Yemen on Wednesday killed at least 35 people and wounded more than 130 others. Kataw was one of at least 19 UN staffers who were detained on August 31 when the Iranian-backed Houthi rebel group raided their offices in the capital city of Sanaa. It was not immediately clear exactly when Kataw was released, but the Jordanian foreign ministry said in a statement she was held in detention for days and that she arrived at a military airport in Jordan on Thursday. It was unclear whether other staffers also had been freed. The IDF rounded up dozens of residents in Tulkarm in the West Bank, forcing them to march in the streets on the way to questioning, after two soldiers were wounded by an explosive device in the city. \"It looks like a collective punishment and a kind of show of force,\" a resident told Haaretz. Military forces raided homes and shops, he said. Senator Jeff Merkley of Oregon and Senator Chris Van Hollen of Maryland published a report categorizing Israel's policy in Gaza as ethnic cleansing and condemned the Netanyahu government for blocking aid headed for the Strip. The senators, both longtime advocates for Palestinian rights and a negotiated peace, visited Israel and the West Bank in late August. Elizabeth Tsurkov had met and spoken with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, the Israeli Prime Minister's Office said in a statement. The office also issued footage of Tsurkov at Sheba Medical Center. Tsurkov is a Russian-Israeli doctoral student who was kidnapped in March 2023 by the Shiite militia while on a research trip in Iraq. On Wednesday, an American source told the Wall Street Journal that she unexpectedly appeared near the U.S. embassy in Baghdad. A senior American official added that Iraqi Prime Minister Mohammed Shia al-Sudani wrote to U.S. President Donald Trump that the release was a gift.", "published": "2025-09-11T05:18:00+03:00", "length": 5302, "source": "www.haaretz.com"}

Varsovie a annoncé l’établissement d’une zone d’exclusion aérienne à la frontière entre la Biélorussie et l’Ukraine. Live animé par Grégor Brandy et Allison Ferrera (service photo) Live en cours Article se déroulant en direct La France va « mobiliser » trois avions Rafale « pour contribuer à la protection de l’espace aérien polonais » , a annoncé Emmanuel Macron sur X, après l’incursion de drones russes en Pologne. « Je m’y étais engagé hier [mercredi] auprès du premier ministre polonais » , poursuit le chef de l’Etat français, ajoutant s’être entretenu avec le secrétaire général de l’OTAN et le premier ministre britannique. « La sécurité du continent européen est notre priorité absolue. Nous ne céderons pas face aux intimidations croissantes de la Russie » , conclut M. Macron dans son message. La Russie a appelé la Pologne à revoir sa décision de fermer sa frontière avec la Biélorussie, une mesure annoncée mardi par Varsovie en réponse aux manœuvres militaires communes russo-biélorusses prévues du 12 au 16 septembre. « Nous appelons Varsovie à réfléchir aux conséquences de telles mesures contreproductives et à reconsidérer la décision prise dans les plus brefs délais » , a déclaré la porte-parole de la diplomatie russe, Maria Zakharova, dans un communiqué. « Il est évident que les mesures de confrontation prises par les dirigeants polonais ne suivent qu’un seul objectif : justifier une politique d’escalade des tensions dans le centre de l’Europe » , a-t-elle ajouté. Les grands exercices militaires entre la Russie et la Biélorussie, baptisés Zapad-2025 (Ouest-2025), doivent débuter vendredi. Ils suscitent l’inquiétude des pays de l’OTAN, en particulier après l’intrusion sans précédent, dans la nuit de mardi à mercredi, de drones présumés russes sur le territoire polonais. Le ministère des affaires étrangères tchèque a annoncé avoir convoqué l’ambassadeur russe pour protester contre l’intrusion d’une vingtaine de drones dans l’espace aérien polonais. « La présence de drones russes en Pologne est une pure provocation de la part du Kremlin. La République tchèque soutient fermement la Pologne. Nous défendrons le territoire de l’Alliance », a écrit le ministre Jan Lipavsky sur le réseau social X. Plus tôt, aujourd’hui, le ministère des affaires étrangères suédois avait également annoncé avoir convoqué l’ambassadeur russe. Selon l’agence de presse ukrainienne Interfax , le ministre des affaires étrangères néerlandais a également convoqué l’ambassadeur russe dans son pays. Le ministre des affaires étrangères polonais, Radoslaw Sikorski, estime, dans une interview accordée hier au média américain PBS , qu’il « est grand temps que Donald Trump comprenne que [Vladimir] Poutine se moque de lui ». « Alors qu’un cessez-le-feu devait entrer en vigueur avant le sommet en Alaska et qu’on devait avoir de sérieuses discussions sur la paix, Poutine envoie de plus en plus de drones, d’abord contre l’Ukraine et maintenant contre l’OTAN » , poursuit M. Sikorski. « J’espère qu’à la fin de ce processus nous aurons une série d’actions coordonnées pour que le président Poutine comprenne que son projet exotique de reconstruction de l’Empire russe ne fonctionnera pas » , assure-t-il, avant de dire croire que « Poutine ne répond qu’aux actions les plus percutantes et qu’il a profité de la bonne volonté du président Trump ». Radoslaw Sikorski s’exprimait après l’intrusion d’une vingtaine de drones attribués à l’armée russe sur le territoire polonais au cours de la nuit de mardi à mercredi. Le ministère des affaires étrangères suédois a annoncé avoir convoqué l’ambassadeur russe pour protester contre l’intrusion d’une vingtaine de drones dans l’espace aérien polonais ; une violation récusée par Moscou mais jugée délibérée par Varsovie. « Les violations russes sont inacceptables et constituent une menace pour la sécurité de l’Europe » , a déclaré Maria Malmer Stenergard, dans un communiqué, soulignant que, durant la rencontre avec le diplomate, « le droit de la Pologne à faire valoir son intégrité territoriale et à défendre son espace aérien a été souligné » .

Ces affrontements se concentrent notamment dans la région de Pokrovsk ( 📍 ), dans l’oblast de Donetsk, dans l’est du pays. Les Ukrainiens annoncent y avoir repoussé 24 des 28 assauts russes et que les combats se poursuivent. A quelques kilomètres au sud-ouest, les Russes ont également lancé neuf offensives dans la direction de Novopavlivka ( 📍 ). L’état-major ukrainien rapporte également deux offensives russes sur le front nord, au nord de Soumy ( 📍 ), et avoir essuyé de nombreux bombardements et tirs d’obus dans la région, située près de l’oblast de Koursk. L’armée ukrainienne affirme avoir avancé de 150 mètres sur plusieurs zones du front. Sur un autre front, au nord-est de Kharkiv ( 📍 ), les forces ukrainiennes disent avoir subi huit tentatives d’avancées russes et trois seraient toujours en cours. L’armée ukrainienne fait également état d’autres offensives russes, toujours dans l’est du pays : dix en direction de Lyman ( 📍 ), sept à l’est de Siversk ( 📍 ), et quelques-unes en direction de Koupiansk ( 📍 ) et Kramatorsk ( 📍 ). Dans le Sud, les Ukrainiens disent avoir fait face à des tirs en direction de Houliaïpole ( 📍 ) et une « attaque inutile » dans la direction de Prydniprovske ( 📍 ). L’Allemagne va renforcer sa contribution à la protection de l’espace aérien polonais, dans le cadre de la « police du ciel » de l’OTAN, en raison de l’intrusion de drones attribuée à la Russie, a fait savoir la chancellerie allemande. Elle « renforcera son engagement à la frontière orientale de l’OTAN en réaction aux récentes violations de l’espace aérien polonais par la Russie » , a annoncé le porte-parole du gouvernement Stefan Kornelius, dans un communiqué. Le ministère de la défense a précisé que la mission va être prolongée de trois mois et que le nombre d’avions de combat va passer de deux à quatre. Le ministère des transports russe a annoncé la réouverture au trafic aérien de l’aéroport de Krasnodar, grande ville du sud du pays, qui était fermé pour des raisons de sécurité depuis le début de l’offensive russe en Ukraine, en février 2022. « L’ouverture de l’aéroport de Krasnodar permettra non seulement d’élargir les possibilités des habitants et des entreprises de la région, mais aussi de rendre plus accessibles les vacances dans les stations balnéaires de la mer d’Azov et de la mer Noire » , s’est félicité le ministère. Cette décision a été prise après l’avis d’un groupe de travail de l’Agence fédérale des transports aériens russe, Rosaviatsia, et la rénovation d’une partie du site. Il s’agit du troisième aéroport du sud de la Russie à rouvrir, sur les onze fermés depuis 2022 compte tenu du risque d’attaques aériennes ukrainiennes. L’aéroport d’Elista, en Kalmoukie, avait repris ses activités en mai 2024 et celui de Guélendjik, dans une région très touristique, en juillet dernier. Le Conseil de sécurité de l’Organisation des Nations unies (ONU) se réunira vendredi à 15 heures (21 heures à Paris) à la demande de la Pologne après l’intrusion de drones présumés russes sur son territoire, a annoncé la présidence sud-coréenne du conseil, jeudi. La demande de réunion est soutenue par plusieurs membres du Conseil de sécurité (Slovénie, Danemark, Grèce, France et Royaume-Uni), selon des sources diplomatiques. Le gouvernement suédois a annoncé jeudi une aide militaire à l’Ukraine d’une valeur totale de 80 milliards de couronnes (7,3 milliards d’euros) sur deux ans, en 2026 et 2027, pour l’aider à lutter contre l’invasion russe. « Nous soulignons ainsi le caractère durable de notre soutien » à Kiev, a déclaré le ministre de la défense, Pal Jonson, en conférence de presse. « Je tiens également à préciser que même si un cessez-le-feu ou même un accord de paix venait à être conclu, le soutien militaire apporté par la Suède à l’Ukraine resterait important et se poursuivrait après un éventuel cessez-le-feu ou accord de paix » , a-t-il ajouté. L’aide militaire annuelle sera donc portée à 40 milliards de couronnes au cours des deux prochaines années. Le ministre de la défense a tenu ces propos en dévoilant une nouvelle aide au titre de l’année 2025. Celle-ci comprend notamment 18 pièces d’artillerie Archer, des munitions ainsi que des drones longue portée, du matériel naval (systèmes de radar côtier, chambres de plongée…) et des équipements pour la défense aérienne. Selon l’institut Kiel , la Suède est, parmi les pays de l’UE, le cinquième plus important donateur à l’Ukraine, en proportion de son PIB. Plusieurs médias ukrainiens rapportent l’arrivée de l’envoyé spécial des Etats-Unis à Kiev. La durée de sa visite en Ukraine n’est pas encore connue. Elle a lieu dans un contexte d’intensification des attaques russes contre les régions ukrainiennes, y compris la capitale, et de l’incursion de drones russes sur le territoire polonais. La dernière visite de Keith Kellogg remonte à la fin du mois d’août . Depuis, il a critiqué les attaques russes sur Kiev , qui menacent le plan de Donald Trump pour la paix en Ukraine. Après la frappe sur le siège du gouvernement ukrainien à Kiev , il avait déclaré : « L’attaque n’est pas un signal de la volonté de la Russie de mettre fin à cette guerre de manière diplomatique. » Le président lituanien, Gitanas Nauseda, a annoncé, jeudi, la libération par le régime biélorusse de 52 prisonniers politiques, à la suite des « efforts continus » de l’administration américaine. « Cinquante-deux prisonniers ont franchi en toute sécurité la frontière lituanienne à partir de la Biélorussie, laissant derrière eux les barbelés, les fenêtres munies de grilles et la peur constante » , a écrit sur X le président Nauseda. « C’est un grand nombre. Pourtant, plus de 1 000 prisonniers politiques restent encore dans les prisons biélorusses, et nous ne pouvons pas nous arrêter tant qu’ils n’auront pas retrouvé la liberté » , a rappelé le chef de l’Etat lituanien. M. Nauseda s’est déclaré « profondément reconnaissant envers les Etats-Unis, et personnellement envers le président Donald Trump, pour leurs efforts continus en faveur de la libération des prisonniers politiques » . Lors d’une conférence de presse, le président lituanien a précisé que, parmi les personnes libérées, se trouvaient « des figures de l’opposition, des journalistes et des participants à des manifestations » . Il n’a pas révélé l’identité des personnes libérées, à l’exception de celle de la ressortissante lituanienne Elena Ramanauskiene, emprisonnée en Biélorussie l’année dernière pour espionnage. De son côté, l’ONG biélorusse de défense des droits humains Viasna a rapporté que Mikola Statkevitch, un opposant historique , faisait partie des prisonniers politiques libérés. En juin, 14 prisonniers politiques avaient été libérés des prisons biélorusses, dont Sergueï Tsikhanovski, le mari de Tatiana Tsikhanovskaïa, la cheffe de file de l’opposition biélorusse en exil. Selon l’agence de presse étatique Belta , aux côtés de Biélorusses, 14 étrangers ont ainsi retrouvé la liberté, dont six Lituaniens, deux Lettons, deux Polonais, deux Allemands, un Français et un Britannique. Le président biélorusse, Alexandre Loukachenko, a donné certaines instructions pour progresser vers une normalisation complète des relations avec les Etats-Unis. Le représentant du président américain, John Coale, a déclaré à la télévision d’Etat locale que Washington avait levé les sanctions contre la compagnie aérienne nationale biélorusse, Belavia. Frappe israélienne sur le Qatar, incursion de drones russes en Pologne. En vingt-quatre heures, le président américain a été pris de court sur les deux dossiers majeurs de politique étrangère dans lesquels il a choisi de s’investir lourdement. Dans les deux cas, aucune stratégie claire ne se dessine. En visite à Kiev, le président finlandais, Alexander Stubb, a accusé jeudi la Hongrie et la Slovaquie d’ « alimenter » l’invasion de l’Ukraine par leurs achats de ressources fossiles russes. Début septembre, Donald Trump s’était dit « très mécontent » des achats de pétrole russe par des pays de l’Union européenne (UE) lors d’une conversation téléphonique qu’il avait eue avec des dirigeants européens, selon le dirigeant ukrainien Volodymyr Zelensky. « Je pense que le président Trump a raison lorsqu’il dit que l’Europe doit cesser d’acheter du pétrole et du gaz russes. Deux pays sont montrés du doigt : l’un est la Hongrie et l’autre la Slovaquie » , a affirmé M. Stubb lors d’une conférence de presse conjointe avec son homologue ukrainien. « Nous veillons à ce que le président Trump sache qui alimente la machine de guerre russe en achetant de l’énergie russe » , a-t-il ajouté. En 2022, après le déclenchement de l’invasion de l’Ukraine par la Russie, l’UE a interdit la plupart des importations de pétrole en provenance de Russie. Mais la Hongrie et la Slovaquie, tous deux membres de l’UE, bénéficient d’une exemption pour continuer leurs importations de pétrole russe via l’oléoduc Droujba, qui a été visé à plusieurs reprises par des frappes ukrainiennes ces dernières semaines. Vendredi, M. Zelensky avait demandé au premier ministre slovaque, Robert Fico, très critique envers l’Ukraine, d’arrêter ses achats de pétrole et de gaz russe, proposant en échange de fournir ces énergies fossiles. Les gouvernements hongrois et slovaques sont connus pour leurs politiques conciliantes envers la Russie et leurs critiques sévères à l’encontre du chef de l’Etat ukrainien, à rebours de la position de l’Union européenne. Les ministres des affaires étrangères d’Ukraine, de Pologne et de Lituanie, réunis dans le cadre du format du Triangle de Lublin, ont publié une déclaration commune à la suite de la violation de l’espace aérien polonais par des drones russes pendant la nuit du 9 au 10 septembre. « Les actions de la Russie et l’assentiment de la Biélorussie à l’utilisation de son espace aérien constituent une menace directe pour la sécurité de toutes les nations de la région » , écrivent-ils. Les ministres ont souligné que seules des actions conjointes et coordonnées pouvaient garantir la sécurité des citoyens dans les trois pays. Ils évoquent la « disponibilité de l’Ukraine à partager toutes les informations de renseignement et opérationnelles disponibles avec la Pologne, la Lituanie et d’autres partenaires, afin de mettre en place un système efficace d’alerte précoce et de protection contre les attaques de missiles et de drones russes » . Les ministres ont appelé les partenaires à renforcer d’urgence la défense antiaérienne de l’Ukraine et à soutenir la Lituanie et la Pologne dans la sécurisation du flanc oriental de l’OTAN et de l’UE C’est un message dont la Chine, membre permanent du Conseil de sécurité de l’Organisation des Nations unies (ONU) et soutien diplomatique de Moscou, a le secret : « La Chine espère que toutes les parties concernées résoudront de façon appropriée leurs différends par le dialogue et la consultation » , a dit lors d’un point presse régulier Lin Jian, un porte-parole du ministère des affaires étrangères chinois.", "published": "", "length": 16465, "source": "www.lemonde.fr"}

L’autorité a été saisie à plusieurs reprises par des députés ou du public, à la suite de la diffusion, vendredi, de vidéos par le média d’extrême droite L’Incorrect . Dans cette séquence filmée en juillet dans un restaurant parisien, on voit Thomas Legrand, chroniqueur à Libération et France Inter, et Patrick Cohen, chroniqueur qui intervient également sur France Inter et « C à vous » (France 5), qui discutent avec Pierre Jouvet, secrétaire général, et Luc Broussy, président du conseil national du Parti socialiste (PS). Au cours de cette discussion, où est aussi évoquée la stratégie de la gauche en vue de l’élection présidentielle de 2027, M. Legrand déclare notamment « [faire] ce qu’il faut pour [Rachida] Dati, Patrick [Cohen] et [lui] » , ce qui a été interprété comme un parti pris à l’encontre de la ministre de la culture sortante et a provoqué une salve de critiques envers les deux journalistes, aussi bien du côté des Républicains que du Rassemblement national et de La France insoumise. Le régulateur de l’audiovisuel, qui auditionnera les deux présidentes à huis clos, a ajouté avoir depuis quelques mois « décidé d’engager une réflexion plus large sur l’exigence d’indépendance et d’impartialité du secteur public de la communication audiovisuelle » . Devant des manageurs de France Télévisions, M me Ernotte Cunci a apporté jeudi « tout [son] soutien » à Patrick Cohen, selon des propos rapportés à l’AFP. « Alors que nous sommes visés par une incroyable polémique née d’images volées, nous devons réaffirmer notre attachement à deux principes fondamentaux : la défense du pluralisme et la défense du journalisme et de la liberté d’informer » , a-t-elle déclaré, affirmant qu’elle ne « déviera pas de cette ligne malgré la pression très forte qui s’exerce sur nous ». Le comité d’éthique de France Télévisions a, de son côté, annoncé se saisir également de cette affaire. « Compte tenu de l’ampleur de la polémique concernant la diffusion d’une conversation entre deux journalistes de l’audiovisuel public et de deux responsables du PS, le comité d’éthique de France Télévisions a décidé de se saisir de cette affaire et publiera prochainement son avis » , selon un communiqué publié mercredi. Thomas Legrand a pour sa part renoncé mardi à son émission hebdomadaire sur France Inter , mais il continuera d’intervenir à l’antenne de cette radio.

Cette décision, rendue mardi 2 septembre, est bien moins sévère que ce que demandait le ministère fédéral de la justice – il exigeait que l’entreprise se sépare de Chrome . Elle constitue un revers pour l’administration Trump, qui avait engagé les poursuites en 2020, mais aussi pour celle de Joe Biden, qui avait poursuivi ce procès et en avait intenté de nombreux autres contre toute la Big Tech. Après l’annonce, l’action Alphabet, la maison mère de Google, progressait de 7 % dans les échanges informels, après la clôture de Wall Street, tandis que l’analyste gourou de Wedbush Securities, Dan Ives, parlait d’une « victoire monstre » pour le groupe. « Google est un monopole et il a agi comme tel pour maintenir son monopole », avait écrit, en août 2024, le juge Mehta, estimant que la firme avait conclu des accords de distribution exclusifs – par exemple avec Apple – pour s’assurer d’une part de marché supérieure à 90 %.

{"url": "https://www.latimes.com/politics/live/live-updates-charlie-kirk-conservative-activist-shot-killed-at-utah-university-event", "title": "Live updates: FBI releases photo of ‘person of interest’ in Charlie Kirk shooting", "body": "FBI releases photos of ‘person of interest’ in Charlie Kirk shooting as manhunt intensifies OREM, Utah — Authorities unveiled a grainy photo Thursday of a man clad in a black long-sleeved T-shirt, dark sunglasses and a baseball cap who they said was “of interest” in the fatal shooting of influential right-wing activist Charlie Kirk at a Utah college campus. Ben Shapiro, influential right-wing pundit, postpones SoCal appearances A pair of Southern California events featuring Ben Shapiro, an influential right-wing pundit and founder of The Daily Wire, have been postponed following  the fatal shooting of Charlie Kirk at an outdoor event in Utah. Shapiro had been expected to attend a book signing at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library in Simi Valley Wednesday night, and was also scheduled to speak at the Young America’s Foundation Wendy P. McCaw Reagan Ranch Roundtable in Santa Barbara early Thursday afternoon. “Out of respect for Charlie, we have canceled YAF’s event in Santa Barbara,” Scott Walker, president of the Young America’s Foundation, wrote in a message online . “But we will not stop. Doing so would mean that the evil assassin who did this wins … The best way to honor Charlie’s life is to continue his work.” Both organizations signaled that their events would be rescheduled. Shapiro, who has slightly diverged from the Trump administration in recent months on subjects such as tariff policy, the war in Ukraine, and the appointment of Steve Witkoff as Trump’s special envoy to the Middle East, remains a prolific and popular voice in right-wing politics. In a post on X on Wednesday, Shapiro shared an anecdote about the time he met Kirk — then 18 — and told a friend, “That kid is going to be the head of the RNC [Republican National Committee] one day.” “Charlie became even bigger and more important than that,” Shapiro wrote. “It was a privilege to watch this principled man stand up for his beliefs and create the single most important conservative political organization in America … we must pick up the baton where Charlie left it, fighting for the things he believed in so passionately.” Utah community members pay respects to Charlie Kirk As the nation reels following the killing of conservative political activist Charlie Kirk, some paid their respects by bringing flowers or American flags to Utah Valley University. FBI offers reward for information on suspect The FBI is offering a reward of up to $100,000 for information leading to the identification and arrest of the individual(s) responsible for the murder of Charlie Kirk on September 10, 2025, at Utah Valley University in Orem, Utah. Contact 1-800-CALL-FBI and submit photos and… pic.twitter.com/ReuzFhdm0H Charlie Kirk’s spiritual advice came from a Ventura County pastor As the nation reeled following the killing of conservative political activist Charlie Kirk , one epicenter of mourning was the Ventura County church whose pastor helped inspire Kirk’s cheerleading for President Trump and jeremiads against the secular left. “My friend Charlie Kirk was murdered today by a coward. His life will be remembered for many wonderful things,” Pastor Rob McCoy of Godspeak Calvary Chapel in Newbury Park wrote on Instagram on Wednesday. MSNBC severs ties with Matthew Dowd over Charlie Kirk comments Political analyst Matthew Dowd lost his contributor role at MSNBC because of comments he made about Charlie Kirk after the young right-wing activist was murdered Wednesday. Shortly after Kirk was shot to death while speaking on stage at Utah Valley State University, Dowd told MSNBC anchor Katy Tur that “hateful thoughts lead to hateful words which then lead to hateful actions.” Charlie Kirk shooting reignites campus free speech issues in Trump era The fatal shooting of Charlie Kirk at a Utah college event has put a spotlight on tensions over free speech at universities, where conservatives, including President Trump, have said campuses are intolerant of right-wing speakers and thought. Kirk, a Trump ally widely credited for revitalizing Republican movements among college students, was speaking before thousands at Utah Valley University when he was shot in the neck. The event was similar to dozens he has held over the years — including at UCLA, USC and Cal State campuses. Kirk typically would sit under a tent to debate attendees who challenged his right-wing views on immigration, gender identity, criminal policy, the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, abortion and other hot-button subjects. Trump to posthumously award Kirk the Presidential Medal of Freedom President Donald Trump gives brief remarks about Charlie Kirk. President Donald Trump announced Thursday that he would award slain Turning Point USA co-founder Charlie Kirk the Presidential Medal of Honor posthumously. Trump paid tribute to Kirk during a memorial service for the 24th anniversary of the Sept. 11, 2001, attack on the Pentagon. Authorities said Thursday they have fresh leads in their massive manhunt for a college-age gunman who killed Charlie Kirk, the influential right-wing activist who founded the conservative youth group Turning Point USA, with a single bullet as he spoke at a Utah college campus. Robert Bohls, the special agent in charge of the F.B.I.’s Salt Lake City office, said that investigators recovered the weapon they believe was used to kill Kirk — a high-powered bolt-action rifle they found in a wooded area near the campus where the shooter had fled — as well as the suspect’s footprints and palm prints. A new era of American political violence is upon us. How did we get here? How does it end? Two assassination attempts on President Trump. The assassination of a Minnesota state lawmaker and her husband and the wounding of others. The  shooting death of a top healthcare executive. The killing of two Israeli embassy employees in Washington. The storming of the U.S. Capitol by a violent mob intent on forcing the nation’s political leaders to their will. And, on Wednesday, the fatal shooting of one of the nation’s most prominent conservative political activists — close Trump ally Charlie Kirk — as he spoke at a public event on a university campus. A single shot: What horrifying videos reveal about killing of Charlie Kirk Multiple videos from the scene show graphic details about the killing of conservative commentator and political organizer Charlie Kirk at a university in Utah on Wednesday. Authorities are now poring over the video as part of the investigation into Kirk’s killing. They are still looking for the gunman after briefly detaining and then freeing two people of interest. ‘Unspeakable tragedy’ rattles Utah Valley University community Thousands of students at Utah Valley University witnessed the fatal shooting of conservative activist Charlie Kirk during a speaking event Wednesday on campus, an act of political violence that sent shock waves through the school community and the nation. Waiting for a flight to Salt Lake City from Los Angeles on Wednesday night, Fran Tolman said she still couldn’t believe what happened at the school, which each of her three sons had attended at some point. Her daughter-in-law was at the event Wednesday morning listening to Kirk, though she’s not currently a student, said Tolman, 69. She said her daughter-in-law recalled the chaos and fear after the gunshot rang out. “Teachers were opening the rooms so that anybody in the crowd could run to safety,” Tolman said. “It’s almost a cliche — you just never think it’s going to happen [at] someplace you know,” she said. “It’s such a quiet place.” She ended up rehashing the tragic day with Dawson Dray, a current Utah Valley University student, who was headed back to school. He said he had a bunch of friends at the event; his group chats were still blowing up with videos and updates from campus. “I would have been there,” said 22-year-old Dray, who considers himself a Kirk fan. “It’s so scary … because it’s Charlie [Kirk] and UVU.” “We are shocked and saddened by the tragic passing of Charlie Kirk,” said university Vice President Val Peterson at a Wednesday news conference. “We express our sincere condolences to the Kirk family. We grieve with our students, faculty and staff who bore witness to this unspeakable tragedy.” In response to the assassination, the university has closed the campus and suspended classes until Monday. Trump calls Kirk a ‘martyr for truth,’ blames ‘radical left’ for his death President Trump called Charlie Kirk a “martyr for truth and freedom” in an address Wednesday evening from the Oval Office, and said that rhetoric spread by the radical left was to blame for ongoing acts of political violence in America. Trump said the assassin’s attempt to silence Kirk by shooting him at a speaking event at Utah Valley University  failed, as the conservative commentator’s voice “has become bigger and grander than ever before.” Trump said that the people on the radical left who had “compared wonderful Americans like Charlie to Nazis and the world’s worst mass murderers and criminals” are “directly responsible for the terrorism that we’re seeing in our country today.” He said “radical left political violence has hurt too many innocent people and taken too many lives,” grouping Wednesday’s shooting together with the assassination attempt on his life in Pennsylvania, attacks on ICE agents, the shooting of House Majority Leader Steve Scalise and the killing of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson . Trump did not mention acts of political violence against Democrats such as the shooting of two Democratic Minnesota lawmakers and their spouses, the arson of Pennslyvania Gov. Josh Shapiro’s home and the attack on Paul Pelosi , husband of former Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi. He vowed that his administration would go after everyone who contributed to the attack on Kirk as well as those who “go after our judges, law enforcement officials and everyone else who brings order to our country.” He praised Kirk for his deep sense of patriotism, his love of open debate and his efforts to get more young people engaged with politics. During the 2024 election, Kirk rallied his online followers to support Trump, prompting conservative podcast host Megyn Kelly to say: “It’s not an understatement to say that this man is responsible for helping the Republicans win back the White House and the U.S. Senate.” “His mission was to bring young people into the political process, which he did better than anybody ever, to share his love of country and to spread the simple words of common sense on campuses nationwide,” Trump said Wednesday. “He championed his ideas with courage, logic, humor and grace.” Chabria: Charlie Kirk’s killing is horrific — and likely not the end of political violence Over the next few days, we are going to hear politicians, commentators and others remind us that political violence is never OK, and never the answer. Person of interest in Charlie Kirk shooting released from custody after interrogation Authorities have released a person of interest who was detained Wednesday afternoon in connection to the the fatal shooting of conservative commentator Charlie Kirk at Utah Valley University. “The subject in custody has been released after an interrogation by law enforcement,” said FBI Director Kash Patel in a statement on X . “Our investigation continues and we will continue to release information in interest of transparency.”", "published": "2025-09-11T18:06:04.243Z", "length": 11428, "source": "www.latimes.com"}

Please report any issues or inconsistencies here . Arguing that the 1st Amendment “deserves better,” a federal judge barred federal agents from targeting reporters with crowd control weapons during protests. Lawyers for the city of Los Angeles and Homeland Security have argued that it isn’t always possible for police to distinguish journalists from protesters during chaotic demonstrations. But U.S. District Judge Hernán D. Vera was unmoved, extending Tuesday restrictions he first ordered in July on the use of less-lethal weapons at street protests. Vera wrote that federal officers “unleashed crowd control weapons indiscriminately and with surprising savagery.” “Indeed, under the guise of protecting the public, federal agents have endangered large numbers of peaceful protestors, legal observers, and journalists — as well as the public that relies on them to hold their government accountable,” Vera wrote in the 45-page opinion. “The First Amendment demands better.” Vera wrote that he expected federal authorities to disseminate the order to their officers and agents in the field. The judge has yet to make a ruling in a separate lawsuit filed against the LAPD over allegations of excessive force by its officers. Less than a month after Vera issued his temporary restraining order limiting the use of force, at least three reporters covering a protest were left bruised and bloody after being struck by LAPD officers’ batons. Tuesday’s decision in the case against the Department of Homeland Security adds a provision to Vera’s previous ruling, also restricting the use of less-lethal weapons against “protesters who are not themselves posing a threat of imminent harm to a law enforcement officer or another person.” The ruling marked a significant victory for a coalition of press rights organizations who have argued in court that judicial intervention was necessary to curb “continuing abuse” of members of the media covering the demonstrations. “Since the federal government began its violent, chaotic invasion of Southern California, our communities have risen together to bear witness and to speak out for their neighbors and loved ones,” Adrienna Wong, a senior staff attorney with the American Civil Liberties Union of Southern California, said in a statement. Under the order, the use of crowd control measures including hard-foam projectile launchers, tear gas, stun grenades and batons are prohibited from being used on or in the vicinity of  members of the press, legal observers, and protesters “unless such force is necessary to stop an immediate and serious threat of physical harm to a person.” Attorneys for both government entities had argued against such a broad ban at the recent court hearing, saying it was impractical and would ultimately put law enforcement at risk. Vera disagreed, writing in his order that “launching scorching-hot tear gas canisters directly at people… will undoubtedly chill the media’s efforts to cover these public events.” The most important California stories and recommendations in your inbox every morning.

Kennedy Jr. have prompted growing calls for his resignation from Democratic lawmakers , career public servants and his own family. But one doctor-turned-governor has other ideas. You're reading the L.A. Times Politics newsletter George Skelton and Michael Wilner cover the insights, legislation, players and politics you need to know in 2024. In your inbox Monday and Thursday mornings. You may occasionally receive promotional content from the Los Angeles Times. Democratic Gov. Josh Green of Hawaii, a career emergency room physician, has privately pressed the Trump administration to create a new post for Kennedy that would remove him from responsibility over vaccines, while allowing him to focus on areas of public health where his theories enjoy greater scientific backing — on nutrition, pesticides and chronic disease, the governor said in an interview. “They’ve simply gone too far, and it’s not the president who’s gone too far. It’s Secretary Kennedy,” Green told The Times, suggesting two Republican appointees — Mehmet Oz, Trump’s current administrator for the  Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, and Jerome Adams, former U.S. surgeon general during Trump’s first term — as potential replacements he would publicly support. “We’re entering flu season,” Green said. “These viruses, if people aren’t vaccinated, will cause large numbers of excess fatalities, and there will be no one to look to for responsibility other than the secretary of Health.” A tense public hearing on Capitol Hill last week laid bare bipartisan concerns over Kennedy’s vaccine skepticism, with three Republican senators — Bill Cassidy of Louisiana, John Barrasso of Wyoming and Thom Tillis of North Carolina — expressing alarm at turmoil within the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention over vaccine guidance and accessibility. Kennedy, at the hearing, stated without evidence that COVID-19 vaccines had caused harm and death, and questioned CDC statistics on how many lives they had saved. “The president is not pleased deep down with this as a distraction,” Green added. “It is not helpful to any administration to have outbreaks.” Without changes in Washington, Hawaii will join a burgeoning alliance of western states to issue independent public health guidance, Green said. The West Coast Health Alliance, formed this month by California, Washington and Oregon, will issue recommendations that rely on many of the career scientists and experts dismissed by Kennedy in recent months, as well as organizations such as the the American Academy of Pediatrics and the American Heart Assn. Kenneth Fink, director of the Hawaii Department of Health, will be the state’s day-to-day representative to the alliance. But “as a physician, I’m also available to the group, to help bring other experts from across the country into the fold,” Green said. The collective has not yet decided whether to set up a formal alternative to the CDC’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, or ACIP, a vaccine advisory panel of experts whose entire membership was fired by Kennedy and replaced by vaccine skeptics. But many  experts are already in touch with Green and other members of the alliance, which has begun discussing how to structure itself. Green, 55, will serve next year as head of the Western Governors Assn., representing 19 states west of the Mississippi River, and is encouraging other states to join the effort, including those led by Republicans. “I really do want to take public health out of politics,” he said. Already, Green and his counterparts have discussed executive actions they can take at the gubernatorial level, in coordination across the alliance, to protect vaccine access. Vaccines pushed off-label by the FDA may need special authorization for access, for example. States may also need to fund vaccine access to individuals who fall outside new federal recommendations for eligibility. Hawaii already anticipates having to spend $15 million in state dollars to ensure everyone who wants a COVID booster shot can receive one, supplementing federal funding, the governor said. “There are going to be some needs to use executive orders from us as governors,” Green said. “I will be doing that. And I’ll be recommending that to my colleagues in the alliance.” In May, Green traveled to Washington to testify before a Senate subcommittee where Republican lawmakers were holding a hearing titled, “The Corruption of Science and Federal Health Agencies.” Its main target was the administration of  COVID vaccines. Green was the sole defender of the pandemic response on a six-member panel. “As a physician, I cared for patients all the way through the COVID pandemic, and we would have had thousands of additional deaths if we didn’t vaccinate our state,” he said. “This is no joke.” “Mr. Kennedy referred to his Senate hearing as theater,” he added. “It’s not theater when you’re an ER doc and you’re caring for patients and having to intubate them.” Hawaii emerged from the pandemic with the lowest mortality rate of any state in the union, and one of the highest vaccination rates. Green served as lieutenant governor at the time. A CDC analysis presented in June, under Kennedy’s leadership, found that COVID vaccines “have been evaluated under the most extensive safety monitoring program in U.S. history,” rejecting conspiracy theories around their association with a range of alleged side effects. The CDC has found a rare but statistically significant number of cases of myocarditis, or inflammation of the heart, in males between ages 18 and 24 who have taken the shots, 90% of whom experience full recoveries and resulting in no known deaths. Under Kennedy, for the first time since its introduction, the COVID vaccine has become difficult to find. The FDA has revoked emergency-use authorization for the shots and is recommending them only for individuals over 65 years old, or those over 5 with underlying health conditions. The Trump administration has also gutted funding of the National Institutes of Health and cut $500 million in funding for mRNA vaccine research, a development that Green called an imminent risk to national security, allowing countries  such as China to dominate access to critical technologies during future public health emergencies that could leave Americans vulnerable. Trump himself has indicated concern, last week telling reporters, “I think you have to be very careful when you say that some people don’t have to be vaccinated. It’s a very, you know, it’s a very tough position.” “You have vaccines that work. They just pure and simple work,” Trump added. “They’re not controversial at all. And I think those vaccines should be used, otherwise some people are going to catch it and they endanger other people. And when you don’t have controversy at all, I think people should take it.” Green saw Trump’s remarks as a sign of a potential shift. “I think that  Secretary Kennedy is doing our country a disservice, and frankly, he’s doing the president a disservice,” Green said. “This is going to hurt the president of the United States and his administration.” The must-read: Barabak: ‘I think it was recklessness’: Harris bashes Biden for late exit from 2024 campaign The deep dive: California has a strict vaccine mandate.
