Read our Privacy notice A senior cabinet minister has admitted that “political considerations” about Peter Mandelson ’s “outstanding singular talents” meant security concerns about the Labour peer being made ambassador to the US were ignored. Business secretary Peter Kyle repeated the claim on Sky News and BBC on Sunday morning that “new information” coming to light over Lord Mandelson’s relationship with the convicted paedophile Jeffrey Epstein led to his sacking on Friday. Last week The Independent revealed that Sir Keir pushed through his appointment earlier this year despite failing security vetting by MI6 . Mr Kyle refused to say if the prime minister spoke to Lord Mandelson directly to let him know he was sacked, nor whether the appointment had been a mistake in the first place. Mr Kyle told Sunday Morning With Trevor Phillips on Sky News it was not correct that Lord Mandelson was appointed ambassador to the US before security checks were completed. He said: “The Cabinet Office did an independent inquiry into the appointment, as they do in every public appointment of this nature, and the information... was presented to the prime minister.” But he admitted that political considerations trumped security concerns about Lord Mandelson, which included not only his relationship with Epstein but also his links to China. In January, The Independent revealed that the same concerns almost led to Donald Trump refusing Lord Mandelson’s credentials. Mr Kyle said: “The second process was obviously a political process where there are political conversations done in No 10 about all the other aspects of an appointment of this nature. Now, both of these things turned up information that was already public, and a decision was made that, based on Peter’s singular talents in this area, that the risk of appointing knowing what was already public was worth the risk.” But he added on Laura Kuenssberg’s Sunday morning BBC show that Lord Mandelson’s appointment had achieved a lot for the UK. He said: “[At the time of the appointment] global norms were turned upside down. The relationship between Britain and America was in a perilous state because of the threat of tariffs. What was happening economically, trying to repurpose and rethink the special relationship. Britain needed somebody with outstanding, singular talents, experience which was very hard to come by.” Explaining the “new information,” Mr Kyle claimed the vetting did not pick up emails that came to light this week showing Lord Mandelson advising Epstein on tackling his conviction, and calling the financier his “best pal”. He added: “Of course we have seen the emails which were not published at the time, were not public and not even known about, and that has changed the situation.” “They had what was public, which was extracts of the emails and... immediately, upon having been alerted to extracts of emails, the Foreign Office contacted Peter Mandelson and asked for his account of the emails and asked for them to be put into context and for his response. That response did not come before PMQs, and then, after PMQs, the full emails were released by Bloomberg in the evening. “By the first thing next morning, when the Prime Minister had time to read the emails in full... almost immediately... Peter was withdrawn as ambassador.” Mr Kyle stressed that the media had the “same information that we had at the time” of the appointment. Opponents said it was “astonishing” that Lord Mandelson’s talents would take precedence over both security concerns and Epstein’s victims. Tory chairman Kevin Hollinrake said: “It is astonishing that the new business and trade secretary has openly admitted that Downing Street chose to prioritise Mandelson’s ‘singular and outstanding talents’ over the rights of Epstein’s victims. Even more damning, this cover-up appears to have continued for a further 48 hours this week as more and more revelations came to light.” Tory leader Kemi Badenoch said she would demand that the prime minister make a statement on the fiasco to the Commons on Monday. She said: “Our weak prime minister is hiding, sending out ministers to answer for his terrible judgement. The last time we saw Starmer was Wednesday, when he told me he had confidence in Mandelson. The PM needs to come to Parliament tomorrow and tell the truth about what he knew and when.” Join thought-provoking conversations, follow other Independent readers and see their replies",2025-09-14 13:15:01,4681,independent.co.uk,en

Read our Privacy notice Elon Musk’s speech at a march organised by Tommy Robinson – in which he told attendees to “either fight back or you die” – has been denounced as “inappropriate” and “disgusting”. The X owner claimed a “dissolution of parliament” and a “change of government” is needed in the UK when he appeared via video link at the huge march on Saturday in London. The speech has sparked criticism, including from the business secretary Peter Kyle, who said the comments were “slightly incomprehensible” and “totally inappropriate”. A Labour source also said that politicians who believe in democracy “should distance themselves from these disgusting comments”. Between 110,000 to 150,000 protesters were estimated to have joined the “Unite the Kingdom” rally , while the Metropolitan Police said around 5,000 people were at an anti-racism counter-protest organised by Stand Up To Racism (SUTR), with over 1,000 officers deployed in a bid to prevent clashes. The force said 25 people have been arrested so far, after 26 officers were injured – including four who were seriously hurt – in scenes of “unacceptable violence”. In 2018, he was jailed for 13 months for breaking contempt of court laws with a Facebook Live video that could have prejudiced a trial. He was already subject to a suspended sentence for committing contempt during a rape trial in Canterbury the year before. Three years later, as The Independent investigated reports he misused donors’ cash, he shouted abuse at the home of the journalist involved , defamed her partner and threatened to return. Convicted of stalking, he was banned from contacting them for five years. In 2022, he spent £100,000 gambling before declaring bankruptcy , the High Court heard. Amid the far-right riots in summer 2024, Robinson organised what he claimed would be the “biggest patriotic rally the UK has ever seen”. Thousands of Robinson’s supporters gathered in central London for the counter-protest to a Stand Up To Racism march. But Robinson missed his own event after being arrested in July 2024 under anti-terror laws over allegations he breached a 2021 High Court order. The order banned Robinson from repeating libellous allegations he made against Syrian refugee Jamal Hijazi. Robinson was later jailed for 18 months in October 2024. In April 2025, Tommy Robinson lost an appeal to reduce his jail term over claims prison segregation was “making him ill”. However, he was released in May 2025, after his sentence was reduced by four months at the High Court. The prime minister has said he “will not stand” for violence against police or for people feeling “intimidated on our streets” after yesterday’s march. Sir Keir Starmer said that he will “never surrender” the use of the British flag to be used as a “symbol of violence, fear and division”. He wrote on X: “People have a right to peaceful protest. It is core to our country’s values. “But we will not stand for assaults on police officers doing their job or for people feeling intimidated on our streets because of their background or the colour of their skin. “Britain is a nation proudly built on tolerance, diversity and respect. “Our flag represents our diverse country and we will never surrender it to those that use it as a symbol of violence, fear and division.” The Tommy Robinson protest is ""one of the biggest far right marches in British history"" and ""an urgent wake-up call for us all"", according to the antiracist group Stand Up to Racism. Police estimates suggest the protest gathered over 100,000 people. This is ""the biggest number of people"" Tommy Robinson has mobilised, ""and goes beyond his usual base,"" the group warned. ""We need far bigger numbers. We need hundreds of thousands,"" the group said, calling for ""campaigners, trade unionists, politicians, faith groups and others"" to come together to build the unity needed to ""stop the far right on the streets and at the ballot box"". Keir Starmer was spotted at the Emirates Stadium in London on Saturday, as violent clashes broke out between police and demonstrators in the centre of the city. The prime minister and his son were seen in the stands watching his favourite football team Arsenal play against Nottingham Forest in a Premier League match. The frontman of the band James has said the group is examining its options after Tommy Robinson used its song in a video without permission. The far-right figure used the indie band’s smash hit ‘Sit Down’ in a video posted on X to highlight the size of the protest he organised in London on Saturday . But James frontman Tim Booth hit back in his own post on X, describing the far-right rally as the “antithesis” of what his band’s song stands for. He wrote: “Disgusted to see the cynical use of ‘Sit Down’ by @TRobinsonNewEra. “No permission was granted, and we are looking into our options. “The song and most of our topical lyrics, make it very clear where we stand, and it’s the antithesis of this organization.” As well as Elon Musk appearing on a video, the “Unite” protest featured speeches from Tommy Robinson and other activists, including former actor Laurence Fox, former Apprentice candidate Katie Hopkins, along with musical performers. It also featured far-right French politician Eric Zemmour, who came in fourth place in the first round of the 2022 French presidential election; leader of the Danish People’s Party Morten Messerschmidt; Petr Bystron of the far-right Alternative for Germany party; Polish right-wing politician Dominik Tarczynski; Belgian anti-immigration activist Filip Dewinter; and television personality Ant Middleton who is running to be Mayor of London. The Met Police have stepped in to correct misinformation posted by X’s AI ‘Grok’ tool. One X user posted a video of ‘Unite the Kingdom’ protesters clashing with police at yesterday’s rally, and asked ‘Grok’ when and where the footage was taken. ‘Grok’ replied: “This footage appears to be from an anti-lockdown protest in London's Trafalgar Square on September 26, 2020, during clashes between demonstrators and police over COVID restrictions.” The Met Police replied stating: “The footage was filmed yesterday, shortly before 3pm, at the junction of Whitehall and Horse Guards Avenue in Westminster. It is not from 2020 and does not show Trafalgar Square.” It also shared its original post from Saturday.",2025-09-14 15:54:27,6573,independent.co.uk,en
https://www.chinadaily.com.cn/a/202509/14/WS68c6d913a3108622abca0a8f.html,Winners of Golden Panda Awards announced,"There's Still Tomorrow, a feminist comedy about a working-class woman fighting gender violence in postwar Italy of the 1940s, which was a huge box-office hit in the country in 2023, won the Best Picture honor at the second Golden Panda Awards held over the weekend in Chengdu, Sichuan province. Conveying her appreciation, the film's director, Paola Cortellesi, said the recognition in China serves as a reminder that ""cinema has the power to connect us beyond borders, languages and cultures"". The winners of the Golden Panda Awards — a biennial event that promotes mutual learning and exchanges among human civilizations — were announced on Saturday night. Director Chen Kaige, jury president of the Awards, told China Daily that the event has encouraged more foreign filmmakers and TV producers to appreciate the China story, especially as global recognition of China has grown thanks to more than four decades of reform and opening-up. ""Films and television often evolve alongside a country's development. For those interested in understanding how a nation grows stronger, screen works can provide some insights. Today, China has an opportunity to show foreign audiences its long-term development through its films and dramas,"" he said. A total of 27 awards — 25 across four categories in film, TV drama, animation and documentary, as well as two Special Jury awards — were selected from 5,343 submissions from 126 countries and regions. Among these, 3,910 were foreign titles, accounting for 73.2 percent of the total. While the Best Actor award in the film category went to Zhu Yilong for his appearance in the noir crime thriller Only the River Flows, Brazilian actress Denise Weinberg took home the Best Actress prize for her role in the dystopian drama The Blue Trail. Describing the event as a bridge connecting Chinese filmmakers to the world, Zhu said he was thrilled to be recognized on the inclusive stage. Perhaps one of the most emotional moments of the awards ceremony was when late filmmaker Pema Tseden — a pioneering figure in Tibetan-language cinema — was honored with the Best Director award for the arthouse film Snow Leopard. Tseden died of a sudden illness at the age of 53 in 2023. Jigme Trinley, Pema Tseden's son and executive director on Snow Leopard, accepted the trophy on behalf of his father, saying the honor was a tribute to his father's artistic life. ""Snow Leopard is my father's eighth Tibetan-language film, condensing his experiences, thoughts and reflections of his entire life, carrying the strength of love and mercy beyond time and space,"" he said. Turkish filmmaker Nuri Bilge Ceylan, along with two fellow writers, won the Best Screenplay award for About Dry Grasses, which explores the emotional struggle of a teacher in a remote Turkish village. Having visited China multiple times in recent years, including serving as jury president of the Shanghai International Film Festival in 2019, Ceylan revealed that his award-winning film is based on the memories of co-writer Akin Aksu, who kept diaries to document his three-year compulsory service as a teacher in Anatolia. In the TV drama category, She and Her Girls — a 23-episode biographical tale chronicling the life of a dedicated teacher — bagged two awards: Best TV Drama and Best Screenplay. The series is adapted from the true story of Zhang Guimei, who founded the country's first free all-girls high school in Yunnan province, helping over 2,000 rural girls realize their college dreams. Scriptwriter Yuan Zidan, who described the drama as ""a very important work"" in her more than 20 years of writing, said the story allowed her to witness the highest expression of noble humanity. Despite poor living conditions and battling multiple diseases, Zhang persevered with her passion and love for education, added Yuan. While James Strong won Best Director in the TV drama category for the British series Mr Bates vs The Post Office, the Best Actress prize went to Tang Yan for her role as a dynamic woman in Blossoms Shanghai, a drama set against the backdrop of the Chinese financial market's early prosperity. Hong Kong actor Francis Ng bagged the Best Actor honor for his vivid portrayal of a determined broker in Escape from the Trilateral Slopes, depicting the fight against drug trafficking. For the other two categories, the Best Animation prize went to Ne Zha 2, China's highest-grossing blockbuster of all times, while Norwegian production A New Kind of Wilderness took home the Best Documentary award. The two-day event, held on Sept 12 and 13, drew over 600 celebrities and industry insiders from home and abroad, turning Chengdu — famous for its spicy hotpots and giant pandas — into a carnival for creators of stories from different cultures and civilizations. British television producer Mal Young, chairman of the TV drama category jury, told China Daily that the event has encouraged collaboration, helping him establish connections with many actors, writers and directors in China. The Liverpool native added that he has now become a fan of China after spending a few days watching the nominated television shows, which provided him with insights like never before. American visual effects artist Joel Hynek, a juror for the TV drama category, said that China displays a very high level of expertise. ""Bringing all these people from around the world together here is a great way to foster connections and mutual understanding across different cultures,"" he said.",,5481,chinadaily.com.cn,en

The female giant panda, who arrived from China last October, celebrated her first birthday at the zoo with a fun-filled event, drawing visitors from around the world. Staff set the scene with honey-smeared ""gift boxes"" filled with sweet potatoes, scattered carrots, and playful balls for Qing Bao. The highlight was a fruit-and-ice cake, featuring a large ""4"" and ice heart, brought in by keepers. When Qing Bao entered, she first showed interest in the carrots and played with a ball before the cake drew her attention. Her first bite was met with a chorus of ""Happy Birthday"" from the crowd. After enjoying the treats, she climbed a tree to rest, drawing ""awws"" and smiles from the audience. In recent weeks, Qing Bao showed signs of pseudopregnancy, a condition where female pandas exhibit pregnancy-like symptoms, such as sleeping more and being sensitive to noise, despite not being pregnant. According to the zoo, keepers kept a close eye on her during the celebrations. Bao Li, Qing Bao's male companion, celebrated his fourth birthday on Aug 4, also enjoying a colorful frozen fruit cake. ""It was fun watching her soon-to-be mate have his birthday a few weeks ago when he turned four. And now she's four,"" said longtime zoo visitor Craig Salvas to China Daily. Visitors shared touching stories of how pandas have become a part of their lives, igniting joy and forging connections. Panda enthusiast Stephanie Smith expressed her heartfelt affection for Qing Bao. ""We love you so much,"" she proclaimed, recalling meeting Qing Bao's father as a cub and Tai Shan, the cub of former zoo panda residents Mei Xiang and Tian Tian, in Dujiangyan, China. Tai Shan was born in 2005 and returned to China in 2010. ""You've made my life so special. You make all of our lives special … and I can't say thank you enough,"" said Smith, offering blessings to Qing Bao and other pandas. Sanpetch, a software developer who accompanied his wife, brought a professional camera to capture the moment. He said they visited Qing Bao earlier this year in March and April, returning for her birthday. ""They're just lovely animals. Wonderful,"" Sanpetch said. ""Happy birthday. She looks wonderful."" Craig Salvas has a decades-long bond with the zoo's pandas. ""I have been coming here since the first pandas came to this zoo in 1973, Ling-Ling and Hsing-Hsing, and watched them grow up, grow old here,"" he said. ""And then when Mei Xiang and Tian Tian came in 2000, watched them grow up and have four babies: Tai Shan, Bao Bao, Bei Bei and Xiao Qi Ji."" The older three cubs returned to China for breeding programs, while Xiao Qi Ji left with his parents in 2023 when their agreement expired. ""And then when they left with Xiao Qi Ji, then Qing Bao and Bao Li came here. So now we have those two pandas, and hopefully they'll have babies in a little while, and we'll watch them grow up,"" he said.",,2999,chinadaily.com.cn,en
https://www.chinadaily.com.cn/a/202509/13/WS68c4d74da3108622abca093e.html,What is artificial intelligence's greatest risk?,"Risk dominates current discussions on AI governance. This July, Geoffrey Hinton, a Nobel and Turing laureate, addressed the World Artificial Intelligence Conference in Shanghai. His speech bore the title he has used almost exclusively since leaving Google in 2023: ""Will Digital Intelligence Replace Biological Intelligence?"" He stressed, once again, that AI might soon surpass humanity and threaten our survival. Scientists and policymakers from China, the United States, European countries and elsewhere, nodded gravely in response. Yet this apparent consensus masks a profound paradox in AI governance. Conference after conference, the world's brightest minds have identified shared risks. They call for cooperation, sign declarations, then watch the world return to fierce competition the moment the panels end. This paradox troubled me for years. I trust science, but if the threat is truly existential, why can't even survival unite humanity? Only recently did I grasp a disturbing possibility: these risk warnings fail to foster international cooperation because defining AI risk has itself become a new arena for international competition. Traditionally, technology governance follows a clear causal chain: identify specific risks, then develop governance solutions. Nuclear weapons pose stark, objective dangers: blast yield, radiation, fallout. Climate change offers measurable indicators and an increasingly solid scientific consensus. AI, by contrast, is a blank canvas. No one can definitively convince everyone whether the greatest risk is mass unemployment, algorithmic discrimination, superintelligent takeover, or something entirely different that we have not even heard of. This uncertainty transforms AI risk assessment from scientific inquiry into strategic gamesmanship. The US emphasizes ""existential risks"" from ""frontier models"", terminology that spotlights Silicon Valley's advanced systems. This framework positions American tech giants as both sources of danger and essential partners in control. Europe focuses on ""ethics"" and ""trustworthy AI"", extending its regulatory expertise from data protection into artificial intelligence. China advocates that ""AI safety is a global public good"", arguing that risk governance should not be monopolized by a few nations but serve humanity's common interests, a narrative that challenges Western dominance while calling for multipolar governance. Corporate actors prove equally adept at shaping risk narratives. OpenAI's emphasis on ""alignment with human goals"" highlights both genuine technical challenges and the company's particular research strengths. Anthropic promotes ""constitutional AI"" in domains where it claims special expertise. Other firms excel at selecting safety benchmarks that favor their approaches, while suggesting the real risks lie with competitors who fail to meet these standards. Computer scientists, philosophers, economists, each professional community shapes its own value through narrative, warning of technical catastrophe, revealing moral hazards, or predicting labor market upheaval. The causal chain of AI safety has thus been inverted: we construct risk narratives first, then deduce technical threats; we design governance frameworks first, then define the problems requiring governance. Defining the problem creates causality. This is not epistemological failure but a new form of power, namely making your risk definition the unquestioned ""scientific consensus"". For how we define ""artificial general intelligence"", which applications constitute ""unacceptable risk"", what counts as ""responsible AI"", answers to all these questions will directly shape future technological trajectories, industrial competitive advantages, international market structures, and even the world order itself. Does this mean AI safety cooperation is doomed to empty talk? Quite the opposite. Understanding the rules of the game enables better participation. AI risk is constructed. For policymakers, this means advancing your agenda in international negotiations while understanding the genuine concerns and legitimate interests behind others'. Acknowledging construction doesn't mean denying reality, regardless of how risks are defined, solid technical research, robust contingency mechanisms, and practical safeguards remain essential. For businesses, this means considering multiple stakeholders when shaping technical standards and avoiding winner-takes-all thinking. True competitive advantage stems from unique strengths rooted in local innovation ecosystems, not opportunistic positioning. For the public, this means developing ""risk immunity"", learning to discern the interest structures and power relations behind different AI risk narratives, neither paralyzed by doomsday prophecies nor seduced by technological utopias. International cooperation remains indispensable, but we must rethink its nature and possibilities. Rather than pursuing a unified AI risk governance framework, a consensus that is neither achievable nor necessary, we should acknowledge and manage the plurality of risk perceptions. The international community needs not one comprehensive global agreement superseding all others, but ""competitive governance laboratories"" where different governance models prove their worth in practice. This polycentric governance may appear loose but can achieve higher-order coordination through mutual learning and checks and balances. We habitually view AI as another technology requiring governance, without realizing it is changing the meaning of ""governance"" itself. The competition to define AI risk isn't global governance's failure but its necessary evolution: a collective learning process for confronting the uncertainties of transformative technology.

Separately, Anwar Atallah, a member of Gaza's city council, is said to have left Gaza two weeks ago with approval from Israeli defense officials. The Civil Administration, the body in charge of Israeli and Palestinian civil affairs in the West Bank, announced on Sunday that its forces evacuated an Israeli citizen with disabilities from a refugee camp in the West Bank's Bethlehem.

Ben Murane, Executive Director of the New Israel Fund of Canada, said Canadian Jews' views on the Gaza war are misrepresented. ""It's been a very dark past week on top of a very dark few years,"" Murane began. ""But I'm so glad you're here because of what we're doing together."" According to Murane, the event is ""an intervention into who represents Canadian Jews."" Too often, he argued, Canadian public discourse frames Jews as split between two extremes: those backing Israel's far-right government, or those who reject Israel entirely. According to Murane, that is not where most Canadian Jews actually are. ""Repeated opinion polls show the majority of us oppose this Israeli government, support a two-state solution, and vote for center-left or left parties,"" he said. He continued, arguing that communal organizations misrepresent this majority in conversations with politicians and media, silencing a vital perspective. ""It's time that more of our voices be heard,"" he said. He also said a climate of fear punishes people who care for both Israelis and Palestinians. ""Caring for both peoples is not contradictory. It is simply being human,"" he said, quoting journalist Marsha Lederman's phrase ""the humanitarian middle"" and describing how NIF's work in Israel models that vision. As examples, he spoke about funding hostage families and human rights groups, aiding Gazans and honoring peace activists like Vivian Silver, murdered on October 7. Murane also shared how Palestinians had named a humanitarian shelter in the Gaza Strip after Silver and that Gazan youth held up photos of Israeli children killed in the Hamas' October 7 attack – in response to the vigils held in Israel where participants hold up posters of Palestinian children killed by the IDF . ""Our mutual care strengthens us and makes us safer,"" Murane said. According to Murane, the three goals of the conference are to show it's okay to care for both peoples, to prove that the humanitarian middle and humane left exist in both Canada and Israel, and to give a platform for voices speaking ""truth to power, peace to war, partnership to division and hope to despair."" In his opening remarks, Haaretz publisher Amos Schocken delivered an assessment of Israel's leadership and the urgent need for a two-state solution. Addressing a packed audience in Toronto, Schocken argued that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's long-standing policies have led Israel into its current crisis and that only a radical shift in direction can change course. ""He will be remembered as Israel's worst prime minister,"" Schocken declared, recalling his 2023 editorial outlining Netanyahu's history of damaging decisions . ""Had Netanyahu accepted the idea of a Palestinian state two years ago, the number of dead hostages, dead Israeli soldiers, and dead Palestinians would have been far, far lower."" Schocken accused Netanyahu of deliberately empowering Hamas to sideline the Palestinian Authority and resist meaningful negotiations. The result, he said, was the October 7 disaster – a direct consequence of ignoring diplomatic avenues while backing hardline strategies. He again urged Netanyahu to support a Palestinian state alongside Israel, referencing both historical precedent and recent international momentum. Citing Mahmoud Abbas's letter to global leaders and Canada's July statement supporting conditional recognition of Palestinian statehood, Schocken made clear that the opportunity for peace, though fading, still exists. ""On Friday at the United Nations, 142 countries voted to endorse the French-Saudi program for a two-state solution ,"" he noted. ""The advantages are clear: ending the bloody Gaza war, granting dignity to Palestinians, eliminating terror, and building an economic partnership that benefits both peoples."" But Schocken warned that Netanyahu's government is barreling ahead in the opposite direction. ""Netanyahu reiterated, loudly and clearly: 'There will never be a Palestinian state,'"" he told conference participants, calling out the coalition's plans to annex large parts of the West Bank and expand settlements, a move Schocken bluntly labeled a ""war crime of ethnic cleansing."" He further accused the Israeli government of indifference to the lives of both hostages and civilians, pointing to last week's bombing of key mediator Qatar and ongoing military actions in Gaza that defy legal and ethical norms. ""Netanyahu and his partners prefer more land even at the cost of human lives,"" Schocken said. ""They serially torpedo negotiations for a hostage and cease-fire deal."" Schocken concluded his remarks by calling on the international community, including Canada, to take stronger action. ""Every country that cares about a humane, fair future must work in close collaboration with those in Israel and Palestine committed to justice and human rights,"" he said. ""It has never been more crucial, or urgent, for this call to be made."" Esther Solomon, editor in chief of Haaretz English, opened the Haaretz Conference in Toronto by outlining the regional impacts of the Gaza war. ""Two years after its savage assault of October 7, Hamas is still holding hostages captive, and Israel is still fighting what increasingly resembles a forever war in Gaza with shocking humanitarian results,"" she began. ""The conflict has escalated across the Middle East – from Yemen to Lebanon to Iran and, more recently, Qatar – with an excruciating cost in civilian lives,"" she said, adding that, ""The impact of the war has gone global."" Solomon continued, saying that the war and ""its management by Israel's hard-right government has had immense and, perhaps, irrevocable repercussions for Israel's politics, for its Jewish and Arab citizens, for its foreign relations, for international norms of warfare and human rights, and for Jewish communities across the world."" She also mentioned recent attempts by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's government to delegitimize civil society protests by equating them with terrorism in what she called ""a continuation of nearly three years of its assault on liberal democracy, accountability and governance."" The goal of the Haaretz Conference, according to Solomon, is ""to try and shed some light on the Gaza war, how to stop it, what might follow it, on the state of Israel's democratic health, with the prospect of general elections on the horizon, and how the international community, including Canada, is – and should – be responding."" At a summit in Doha attended by leaders from Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Egypt, Jordan, and the Palestinian Authority, Qatari Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Sheikh Mohammed al-Thani condemned Israel's strike on Qatar, calling it ""state terror and a consistent policy of the extreme Israeli government."" He described the attack as ""arrogant, reckless, and a violation of the sovereignty of a UN member state,"" warning that it is a dangerous escalation threatening regional peace, security, and stability. Sheikh al-Thani added that Israel's actions ""demonstrate its intention to reject any path to peace and resolve the Palestinian issue by force"" and argued that they are encouraged by ""the international community's inability to hold Israel accountable."" A Haaretz conference in Toronto is about to begin , together with the New Israel Fund of Canada and JSpaceCanada. The conference will be streamed live, and highlights will be shared in this blog. Against the backdrop of the approaching two-year anniversary of October 7, the enduring war in Gaza, and the expansion of conflict across the region, speakers will ask hard questions about Israel's future: What kind of Israel will emerge from this extended crisis? Who will rebuild Gaza, and how? What role do Israel's allies, including Canada, have during and after the war? How are the shockwaves from October 7, the hostage crisis and the ongoing conflict affecting Diaspora Jews' identity, safety, and their relationship with Israel? Who are the Palestinian partners for building a common future? The conference will feature addresses from Haaretz Publisher Amos Schocken , New Israel Fund of Canada Executive Director Ben Murane , and Canadian MP and Environment Minister Julie Dabrusin . Former Israeli Deputy Prime Minister Dan Meridor , as well as Knesset members Naama Lazimi of The Democrats and Ayman Odeh of Hadash-Ta'al, will also speak, alongside Alana Zeitchik, an Israeli-American advocate and family member of hostages. A series of conversations and panels will feature, among others, Amos Harel , Haaretz's senior military correspondent; Maj. Gen. (res.) Yair Golan, leader of The Democrats party; Brig. Gen. (res.) Asaf Agmon, protest leader and former Israel Air Force official; Ahmed Fouad Alkhatib of the Atlantic Council; Ksenia Svetlova of ROPES; former Canadian minister Omar Alghabra ; Maytal Kowalski of JSpaceCanada; Prof. Thomas Juneau of the University of Ottawa; Libby Lenkinski , founder of the Albi Fund; Mohanad Berekdar of the Nasij program; and Dahlia Scheindlin , Haaretz columnist and political scientist. More than 1,500 police officers have been deployed ahead of the final stage of the Spanish Vuelta in Madrid on Sunday as more pro-Palestinian protests were expected for the final stage of the three-week-long cycling race. The Grand Tour event turned into a diplomatic battleground and was largely disrupted by protesters against the presence of Israeli-owned team Premier Tech, which earlier in the race removed the team name from its uniforms. Six of the last 10 days of racing were either cut short or interrupted, with more than 20 people detained by police. During one stage, a protester carrying a Palestine flag tried to run on to the road ahead of riders, causing two of them to crash. They continued, but one of them had to eventually pull out of the race. The route of the final stage, which is set to end Sunday evening in the Spanish capital, was cut short by 5 kilometers (3.1 miles) over traffic concerns. Previous stages were altered because of safety concerns over the protests. Authorities said the heavy police presence would be deployed for the finale in Madrid to add to the 130 officers already traveling with the race. Israeli fire killed 68 Palestinians in Gaza, including 10 aid seekers, and wounded a further 346 Palestinians over the past 24 hours, the Gaza Health Ministry reported on Sunday. The ministry also reported that two people died of hunger and malnutrition over the past day, as cases of death by hunger rose to 422, including 145 children. The overall death toll provided by the ministry now stands over 64,800 killed and around 165,000 wounded since the war began. About 20,000 wounded soldiers from the current Gaza war are being treated by the Israeli Defense Ministry's rehabilitation department, of which 10,700, or 55%, are dealing with psychological wounds, said the Ministry. 20% of those with mental wounds were also physically hurt, whereas 45% are only physically wounded, per the Ministry. 64% of the patients are reserve soldiers, and 92% are men. The rehabilitation department estimates that by 2028 it will treat 100,000 wounded, including 50,000 with psychological wounds. A year ago, the department estimated it would reach that number by 2030, but due to the expansion of the Gaza campaign, its estimates have changed.",2025-09-14 01:56:00,12357,haaretz.com,en

Une gauche qui s’écharpe devant des militants qui crient à l’unité : la gauche a offert un drôle de spectacle à la 90 e édition de la Fête de L’Humanité , qui s’est tenue au Plessis-Pâté (Essonne) du vendredi 12 au dimanche 14 septembre. Fil rouge de ces trois journées, les dissensions entre le Parti socialiste (PS) et les « insoumis ». En terrain conquis sur cette ancienne base aérienne de l’Essonne, le mouvement de Jean-Luc Mélenchon a déployé ses meilleurs efforts pour torpiller le PS et pour briser sa bonne entente avec Les Ecologistes et le Parti communiste (PCF). Une longue passe d’armes a eu lieu samedi en direct sous le chapiteau de l’agora lors d’un débat unitaire. Avant même de dire un mot, le premier secrétaire du PS, Olivier Faure, a été hué par le public. « Vendu » , « trahison » , a-t-on entendu dans les travées bondées. « Quelles sont les raisons qui vous poussent à me nuire alors que je n’ai pas parlé ? » , a interrogé le député de Seine-et-Marne. Galvanisé, le député La France insoumise (LFI) de Haute-Garonne Hadrien Clouet a décoché plusieurs flèches à son endroit. Sans le nommer, il l’a invité « à ne pas glisser dans l’union bourgeoise » ou vers « un macronisme finissant » et a fustigé les « contre-budgets capitulards ». Allusion à la stratégie du parti à la rose, dont le budget alternatif ne reprend pas les mesures du Nouveau Front populaire (NFP). Il vous reste 81.29% de cet article à lire.

Le groupe échappe au démantèlement. Cette décision, rendue mardi 2 septembre, est bien moins sévère que ce que demandait le ministère fédéral de la justice – il exigeait que l’entreprise se sépare de Chrome . Elle constitue un revers pour l’administration Trump, qui avait engagé les poursuites en 2020, mais aussi pour celle de Joe Biden, qui avait poursuivi ce procès et en avait intenté de nombreux autres contre toute la Big Tech. Après l’annonce, l’action Alphabet, la maison mère de Google, progressait de 7 % dans les échanges informels, après la clôture de Wall Street, tandis que l’analyste gourou de Wedbush Securities, Dan Ives, parlait d’une « victoire monstre » pour le groupe. « Google est un monopole et il a agi comme tel pour maintenir son monopole », avait écrit, en août 2024, le juge Mehta, estimant que la firme avait conclu des accords de distribution exclusifs – par exemple avec Apple – pour s’assurer d’une part de marché supérieure à 90 %.

https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2025-09-14/crimes-of-the-times-the-fall-of-l-a-sheriff-lee-baca,A popular L.A. sheriff touted reforms in a troubled system. Then a young FBI agent showed up,"This is read by an automated voice. Please report any issues or inconsistencies here . When Leah Marx began visiting Men’s Central Jail in downtown Los Angeles in 2010, it did not immediately raise alarm among the people who ran it. Most of the time, jailers just looked at her federal ID and let her in without asking why she was there. If they did, she said she was investigating a human trafficking case. It was a good-sounding story. Believable. Perfect to deter further questions. Marx was in her late 20s, just beyond her rookie year at the FBI. She had been sitting at her desk when her supervisor handed her a letter from an inmate alleging jailers were brutalizing people in their custody. It was different from other letters. It had details. Now she and her FBI colleagues were at the jail conducting secret interviews, trying to separate fact from rumor. The L.A. County Sheriff’s Department ran the jails. With a daily population of 14,000 inmates or more, it was the nation’s largest jail system, and had been known for years as a cauldron of violence and dysfunction. The agency was in the hands of a would-be reformer, Sheriff Lee Baca . He’d promised transparency. He’d won praise for his ambitious inmate education program. But stories persisted of violent and corrupt jailers, of deputy gangs, of an institutional culture so entrenched it resisted all efforts to root it out. Marx seemed an improbable federal agent (at first, even to herself). She had been getting a master’s degree in social work when someone suggested she try the FBI. She did not know they hired people like her. She was new to L.A., and living alone with her dog. As she gathered inmate stories, she made it a point to emphasize that their charges were irrelevant to her. “I think they started to believe that I was there to actually hear what was going on,” she told The Times. Inmates were telling her versions of the same story. A jailer would assault an inmate while yelling “Stop resisting,” then charge the inmate with assault on a police officer. As she weighed the credibility of inmates against jailers , Marx was informed by a painful episode in her family history. Growing up in Wisconsin, she knew only the outlines of a tragedy too painful for the family to discuss — her grandmother and uncle had long ago died in a house fire in California. In high school, she learned that the fire had been intentionally set, that the suspected arsonist worked at the local police department. He’d benefited from the air of impunity his position afforded. “Someone’s position doesn’t dictate whether they are more truthful or less truthful than anyone else,” Marx would recall. “You don’t get instant credibility due to your position or your role.” In this series, Christopher Goffard revisits old crimes in Los Angeles and beyond, from the famous to the forgotten, the consequential to the obscure, diving into archives and the memories of those who were there. At the jail, she found an inmate eager to help — Anthony Brown, a bank robber waiting to be transported to state prison on a 423-year prison sentence. He told her about a jailer who had offered to bring him a contraband cellphone for the right price, and she orchestrated a sting in summer 2011. An undercover agent handed over the money, and the jailer delivered the phone to Brown. The phone was supposed to help Brown document what he saw. And it gave the FBI leverage to launch an ambitious operation . The FBI would rent out a warehouse said to be full of drugs, and use the compromised jailer to recruit corrupt colleagues to moonlight as guards. But the plan was dead before it could even get off the ground. Nor did Brown get anything useful with his phone during the week and a half that he had it. On Aug. 8, 2011, deputies found the phone in his cell, stashed in a Doritos bag. Baca did not talk like other lawmen. He often sounded like a social worker, or a panelist at a self-improvement seminar. “I tend to be one that says, ‘All right, constant growth, constant creativity,’” he would say. “All humanity matters.” Baca had been raised by his grandparents in a Mexican American family in L.A. He dug ditches, washed cars and hauled barley sacks. He joined the Sheriff’s Department at age 23 in 1965, got a PhD from USC and worked his way up to become one of the state’s highest-ranking Latino law officers. When he took over the Sheriff’s Department in 1998, he promised a new age of law enforcement at the vast, scandal-plagued agency. By the summer of 2011, he was almost 70 and had run the department for 13 years. Voters had reelected him three times. When it became clear that the FBI had been secretly investigating his jails for a long time, the man who preached reform and accountability faced an unprecedented test. He could cooperate fully with the federal investigation. Instead, he decided to go to war. His department turned Marx’s informant into a ghost, shuttling him between facilities under a series of fake names, as Marx tried doggedly to find him. Even a federal writ failed to produce him. When Marx finally found him 18 days later, at Lancaster State Prison, he met her with hostile silence — he believed the FBI had left him for dead. Baca, furious about the intrusion onto his turf, told the local FOX 11 morning show “Good Day L.A.” that the feds had broken the law by planting a phone on one of his inmates. Introducing Crimes of the Times, a new podcast from L.A. Times Studios L.A. Even as he spoke, his department had a surveillance team on Marx. That afternoon in September 2011, as she approached her apartment, two sheriff’s sergeants were waiting for her. “I’m in the process of swearing out a declaration for an arrest warrant for you,” said Sgt. Scott Craig. He had his jacket off, and his gun was showing. Marx interpreted it as an attempt to intimidate her. She told him to call the FBI. “And the first thought I had is if they were willing to come to my house and do this, what else are they capable of?” she said. Baca confronted U.S. Atty. Andre Birotte, who had approved the jail investigation. According to Birotte’s trial testimony later, Baca erupted angrily, “I’m the goddamn sheriff. These are my goddamn jails. You want to gun up in here? Is that what you want?” Birotte took the phrase to mean, “Do you want our agencies to go to war?” Inside the FBI, there was an ongoing debate about whether to include Baca in the jail investigation. He was a valuable law enforcement ally. His deputies worked with the feds on many task forces. But the incident outside Marx’s apartment largely ended that debate. “If that isn’t a clear indication that we cannot work with them, I don’t know what is,” said Carlos Narro, who was the FBI’s public corruption supervisor in L.A. at the time. The sheriff had catastrophically misjudged his adversary. Instead of quashing the probe, his heavy-handed tactics had only fueled it. Was it possible to expand the case beyond civil rights violations to an obstruction of justice case? How exactly was Brown made to vanish inside the jail system? James Sexton had some answers. The son of a Southern sheriff, he had joined the LASD hoping to make his name. He was only a few months into his job as a custody deputy at the downtown jail in 2009 when he learned the price of nonconformity. A robbery suspect sucker-punched him, he says, and his colleagues ostracized him for failing to retaliate with a beating. Still, Sexton’s tech prowess and other skills began to win him some attention, and ultimately earned him a job with an elite intelligence unit. In August 2011, his expertise with the jail computer system made him useful. The brass had an unusual request. They wanted him to make an informant disappear. “We were going to make it difficult for other law enforcement agencies to find him on the computer,” he said. “And then they all looked at me.” Sexton had learned the price of defiance. He helped to change Brown’s name. The aliases included John Rodriguez, Kevin King, Chris Johnson and Robin Banks. When sheriff’s officials decided to unload Brown on the state prison system, Sexton wrote an email notifying his bosses. “Gents,” Sexton wrote, “I’m going to handle booking our friend back under his true alias.” The email would become a crucial piece of evidence. In it, Sexton coined the term that would become inseparable from the whole scheme. The subject line: Operation Pandora’s Box . Sexton thought the Brown episode was behind him. But in early 2012, he said, he was scared. He had reported misconduct on an unrelated case, involving another jailer’s possible association with a skinhead gang. He knew he would never be trusted again. Co-workers were calling him a rat. He decided to become an informant for Leah Marx. He was surprised at how little she acted like a cop. “I got a social worker,” he said. “You gotta love the calculation of the FBI. She is easy to talk to. I should have been smarter.” Sexton talked to the FBI dozens of times. He told a federal grand jury how he had manipulated the jail computers to hide Brown from his federal handlers. This admission would hurt him severely. In December 2013, he was indicted, one of 18 current or former sworn members charged with civil rights violations, corruption, inmate abuse or obstruction. Among them were the two sergeants who had confronted Marx outside her home. At trial, Sexton’s attorney portrayed him as an “overeager kid” trying to help the FBI, a low-ranking jailer who exaggerated his importance in the scheme. The attorney compared him to Walter Mitty, the character with the boring office job who escapes into elaborate imaginative worlds — a defense Sexton hated. He was convicted and received an 18-month term. He was thrown into solitary confinement. He counted the days by plucking teeth off a comb. After four months in prison, Sexton appeared before a federal judge and said, “I stand before you as a broken man.” The prosecutor agreed to let him go home. The sheriff was not an easy man to pin down. As he sat down to face questions from the feds, his sentences traveled winding paths through vague precincts to fog-filled destinations. He bragged about the thousands of inmates who were getting an education in his jails, thanks to programs he had established. “No one is a greater believer in inmate rights than I am,” he said. His answers were frequently long-winded, muddled and incoherent. Again and again, he denied having advance knowledge of what his department had done — from making Brown disappear, to threatening Marx with arrest. The FBI had not asked his permission to infiltrate his jails because it had not trusted him, but Baca seemed to find this fact intolerable, if not incomprehensible. He seemed personally hurt by it. “There’s no evidence of a malicious intent on my part to undermine the mission of the FBI,” Baca said. “You wanna catch all the crooked deputies I have; in fact, it’s helpful because I don’t have enough budget to do it all myself.” For Baca, this interview — which prosecutors would portray as a web of falsehoods — represented the culmination of a long series of misjudgments and self-inflicted wounds . Baca had once told the ACLU, “I will never, ever resign. I intend to be sheriff as long as I live.” He had run unopposed at the last election, his fourth. But in January 2014, he stood outside the department’s Monterey Park headquarters, fighting emotion as he announced his resignation. He had been sheriff for 15 years and had worked at the department for nearly half a century. In late 2016, the 74-year-old Baca went to trial. His supporters wore lapel pins in the shape of a badge. His defense: He had been in the dark about what his subordinates were doing to foil the feds. Some of Baca’s prominent friends, including two former L.A. County district attorneys, testified to his law-abiding reputation. The jury deadlocked. At the retrial, prosecutors called convicted high-ranking co-conspirators to the stand. A former captain said Baca had personally approved the plan to send sergeants to Marx’s house, adding: “his advice to us was just not to put handcuffs on her.” In March 2017, Baca became the 10th and highest-ranking participant in the obstruction scheme to be convicted . His lawyer pleaded with the judge, saying Baca had Alzheimer’s disease that amounted to its own terrible punishment, “a sentence that will leave him a mere shell of his former self.” But the judge gave Baca three years , excoriating him for abusing the public trust. At 77, Baca turned himself into a low-security facility outside El Paso. According to a friendly biography, he reorganized the prison library and renovated the prison pond, and cleared brush from the grounds. He inspired other inmates by his example. He made friends, he gave advice. He told people to make use of their time. He went home in 2021. Three years later, at age 82, he wandered away from home in San Marino. He turned up six miles away at a Denny’s, badly confused. If not for Baca’s decision to “gun up” against the feds, they probably would have brought a handful of civil rights cases against jailers — and Baca would have won reelection. “All the big prosecutions we did was because of how they reacted,” says Brandon Fox , the former prosecutor. “This was an existential threat to the Sheriff’s Department, but it was of their own making because of what they did.” Brown is in state prison serving his 423 years. He filed suit claiming the Sheriff’s Department had effectively kidnapped him during those 18 days, and the L.A. County Board of Supervisors approved a $1-million payout to settle the claim. Among the ironies: He got nothing of value on the cellphone that so enraged the sheriff, and prosecutors never called him to testify at trial, knowing the defense was likely to eviscerate him. In the end, 22 members of the Sheriff’s Department were convicted as a result of the probe initiated by special agent Leah Marx. It seems likely her youth and inexperience helped her, that veteran agents would have weighed the odds and decided it wasn’t worth pursuing. “We don’t know how many more civil rights cases we could have brought because the department came in and disrupted our investigation,” Marx says. “They tried to intentionally stop what we were doing. And so, sadly, we don’t know where it would’ve gone. And that’s a little frustrating.” The podcast “Crimes of the Times,” featuring “ Pandora’s Box: The Fall of L.A.’s Sheriff ,” is now available wherever you get your podcasts.

https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/tv/story/2025-09-14/emmy-awards-security-lapd,"LAPD says it’s ‘fully prepared’ for Emmy Awards, a high-security event","This is read by an automated voice. Please report any issues or inconsistencies here . The Emmy Awards bring together the best and brightest in television each year, and as such, it’s always a tightly secured event. This year will be no exception. The security measures for Sunday’s awards ceremony, which will be held at the Peacock Theater at L.A. Live in the heart of downtown, was reviewed with close eyes this week in light of Wednesday’s fatal shooting of political commentator Charlie Kirk in Utah. With any large event, law enforcement officials and organizers take caution with security measures, but the recent spate recent of political violence targeting elected officials and those in the public eye have brought increased attention to how these large and highly publicized events are secured. Security experts say drones will be increasingly used to spot rooftop gunmen like the one who shot Charlie Kirk and the would-be assassin who wounded President Trump last year. Though LAPD did not offer specifics about the security measures it was taking, an official for the department said they are ready for the event. “For security reasons, the Department does not discuss protective measures for special events or any public gatherings. What I can assure you is that we are appropriately staffed and fully prepared,” said Jennifer Forkish, LAPD communications director. For several years, the LAPD has had a SWAT team at the scene, and numerous Metro officers and counter snipers have been visibly stationed on rooftops. Law enforcement officials also design a vehicle approach with barriers that prevents car bombings and vehicle attacks. Since the attacks on 9/11, the 24th anniversary of which were recognized this week, the department has applied an extensive layer of security to the biggest awards ceremonies with large red carpets. The Peacock Theater also has security personnel who use metal-detector screening, visual inspection and bag inspection to keep guests safe. The Television Academy revisited its security system for the weekend in light of Kirk’s shooting death at a speaking event on a college campus. “We’re absolutely relooking at all of our security plans, but we always have a very robust security plan in place,” Television Academy president and chief executive Maury McIntyre told Variety on Thursday. “I know that basically once things happened yesterday, our security personnel all gathered together to just recheck things like that. Sitting with the LA Police Department, sitting with our department of transportation, just to make sure that we felt buttoned up. We are confident in the plans we’ve got in place.” Here’s everything you need to know about the 2025 Emmy Awards, including how to watch the ceremony, who the presenters will be and who might win.

https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2025-09-14/oscar-eagle-wrongful-conviction-lapd,"An infamous LAPD scandal, a gang shooting and a 25-year fight to prove a teen innocent","This is read by an automated voice. Please report any issues or inconsistencies here . On the night Los Angeles police claim he carried out an act of gangland vengeance, Oscar Eagle could barely walk. In March 1998, Eagle was only 17 and using crutches to get around after he was wounded in a drive-by shooting. The bullet is still in his leg to this day, marked by a coin-shaped indentation on his calf. At the same time that police allege Eagle opened fire on an 18th Street gang member in an act of retribution, he says he was at an East L.A. hospital because a friend’s cousin was giving birth, according to court records. Eagle knew he was innocent. Witnesses placed him at the hospital and he said medical records could prove he wasn’t mobile enough to carry out the crime. But a combination of dubious legal representation and an arrest made by members of a notoriously corrupt  unit in the Los Angeles Police Department saw Eagle sentenced to 25-years-to-life in prison. In July, a judge granted a joint motion from the California Innocence Project and the L.A. County district attorney’s office to vacate Eagle’s conviction, citing ineffective assistance of counsel and questions about the behavior of LAPD detectives on the case. For reform advocates, Eagle’s case epitomizes the problem with prosecuting teens as adults, but it also marks a positive sign for the L.A. County district attorney’s office’s conviction review unit under Nathan Hochman, who personally appeared at the hearing where Eagle was set free. “This is what I’ve been dreaming of every day,” a tearful Eagle, 45, said during an interview in late July. Formed in 2015 and expanded under former Dist. Atty. George Gascón, Hochman has shown a continued commitment to the conviction review unit. After facing criticism for recording just four exonerations from 2015 to 2020, the unit has been involved in 12 in just the last four years, according to a district attorney’s office spokesperson. “I think that a D.A. sends a strong message when you appear in court, that it’s both a case of serious concern to the D.A.’s office, and it’s one where you want to see justice done,” Hochman said. A former Republican who rebranded as an independent, Nathan Hochman promised to ‘get politics out’ of the D.A.’s office, but his neutrality has raised eyebrows amid the immigration raids. Seeing L.A. County’s top prosecutor personally endorse his release is a stark turnaround for Eagle, who spent most of his life believing police would do anything to keep him behind bars. After entering California’s adult prison system as a teenager, Eagle said he watched a friend die in a riot at Pelican Bay. He spent years in isolation after he says he was erroneously connected to the Mexican Mafia. Both of his parents died while Eagle was locked up, and he can’t even mention their names without tearing up to this day. Eagle said he grew up in a section of Pico-Union where all his neighbors were affiliated with a local gang set, the Burlington Locos. A young tagger who went by “Clown,” he too wound up part of the crew. In the late 1990s, Eagle became a target of detectives with an infamous LAPD unit known as C.R.A.S.H., short for Community Resources Against Street Hoodlums. At the time, the LAPD’s Rampart division was home to C.R.A.S.H. officers who falsified reports and framed civilians, later triggering a scandal that ended with the U.S. Department of Justice placing the LAPD under a consent decree. Eagle says that in 1996 he was wrongfully arrested for gun possession as a juvenile by Rafael Perez, the central figure of the Rampart  scandal. Perez later admitted the report that led to Eagle’s first arrest was falsified, according to court records. But it was Eagle’s next run-in with police that proved far more consequential. In March 1998, 18th Street Gang member Benjamin Urias was shot twice on Burlington Avenue in what police believed to be retribution for a prior attack on a Burlington Locos member, court records show. Urias, who was hospitalized for two days and released, told police the shooter walked with a limp. Investigators from a C.R.A.S.H. unit based in Rampart locked onto Eagle, due to his gang connections and the fact that he was said to be walking with a limp after he was injured in a shooting, according to his attorney, Megan Baca, of the California Innocence Project. Charges against Eagle were initially dismissed after Urias failed to show up for a preliminary hearing. But a month later, LAPD homicide detectives Thomas Murrell and Kenneth Wiseman prodded the shooting victim to pick Eagle out of a photo lineup, according to the motion to vacate his conviction. Urias initially told police he did not recognize anyone in the lineup, records show. “OK, circle that guy ... Number 4 is the one you were pointing to,” Murrell said to Urias, according to a recording of the interview described in court records. LAPD Internal Affairs Det. Joseph Lloyd has been assigned to investigate many of the department’s biggest scandals. He’s also become a lightning rod of controversy. An LAPD spokesperson declined to comment. The audio recording that called the validity of the identification into question was never raised at Eagle’s trial, according to Baca. Despite concerns about the behavior of the detectives, Hochman said he was not immediately ordering a review of other cases involving Murrell and Wiseman. Neither Rampart detective was part of a C.R.A.S.H. unit. Murrell denied any wrongdoing and told The Times he remembered Eagle’s name because the then-teenager was a suspect in multiple gang homicides at the time. He did not offer specifics, but dismissed Eagle’s medical alibi, contending the teen “wasn’t on crutches” when police arrested him. “If he made an ID, we didn’t cheat, I can tell you that … I’ve never done that,” said Murrell. “We did everything by the book.” Attempts to contact Wiseman were unsuccessful. Eagle said things were only made worse by his former attorney, Patrick Lake, who didn’t make an opening statement at trial or raise any of Eagle’s alibi evidence. When Eagle questioned his lawyer, Lake joked that he was “saving the best for last.” As Eagle’s family grew frustrated in the gallery, he said his mother passed him a note that simply read “fire him.” Eagle tried to get rid of Lake, but a judge denied his request. Eagle was convicted of murder. And since he was tried as an adult, he faced 25-years-to-life. Lake did not respond to a request for comment. Baca said she had one conversation with Lake, in which he claimed he didn’t remember Eagle or his case. At the time, prosecutors in California could directly file charges against teens in adult court, sending hundreds of children every year to adult prisons  such as Pelican Bay, where Eagle wound up. That practice has been abolished by a change in state law, but Baca said she’s encountered too many cases where teens had their lives stolen because they were wrongfully convicted and tried as adults. “It’s egregious, but I think that it happens all the time,” Baca said. “So many of my clients were juveniles and they got adult life.” The California attorney general’s office and the Torrance Police Department have reached an “enforceable agreement” to reform the agency following a scandal that saw more than a dozen officers exchange racist and violent text messages in which they joked about killing Black people. Eagle said his stay in prison was long and painful. He spent six years in segregated housing, essentially isolation, after Baca said her client was wrongly labeled as a Mexican Mafia associate. He denied any affiliation with the powerful prison-based syndicate. Eagle said prison officials took a leap in logic to link him to the gang based on a “kite,” or prison note, sent by another inmate. Even though he knew he hadn’t committed the crime that put him in prison, Eagle said he still realized there were things about his life that needed to change. “I was 30 years old. My perspective started to change. And I started to see this past life that I was living was nonsense,” he said. “I started to have a conscience.” In 2023, after repeated failures to get his case overturned on appeal, some of Eagle’s friends got the attention of Baca and the California Innocence Project, which worked to bring the case before the conviction review unit. At the same time, Eagle said, he started exchanging letters with an ex-girlfriend from high school, a woman named Monica. In July, the two squeezed next to each other on Baca’s couch at the lawyer’s Long Beach home, hands interlocked. They’ve since gotten married and are looking to move to Arizona, away from the city and county that nearly took everything away from Eagle. There’s still a lot for Eagle to get used too — he’s never driven a car, the concept of Uber is still bizarre to him — but Monica says there’s one silver lining to the prison term Eagle never should have served. She wouldn’t have married the guy who was sent away all those years ago. “He’s a whole new person from when he went in,” she said.
